<p id="id01122" style="margin-top: 3em">An Invitation in Writing</p>

<p id="id01123" style="margin-top: 3em">THE NEXT DAY, November 9, I woke up only after a long,
twelve-hour slumber.  Conseil, a creature of habit, came to
ask "how master's night went," and to offer his services.
He had left his Canadian friend sleeping like a man who had never
done anything else.</p>

<p id="id01124">I let the gallant lad babble as he pleased, without giving him
much in the way of a reply.  I was concerned about Captain Nemo's
absence during our session the previous afternoon, and I hoped
to see him again today.</p>

<p id="id01125">Soon I had put on my clothes, which were woven from strands of
seashell tissue.  More than once their composition provoked comments
from Conseil.  I informed him that they were made from the smooth,
silken filaments with which the fan mussel, a type of seashell quite
abundant along Mediterranean beaches, attaches itself to rocks.
In olden times, fine fabrics, stockings, and gloves were made from
such filaments, because they were both very soft and very warm.
So the Nautilus's crew could dress themselves at little cost,
without needing a thing from cotton growers, sheep, or silkworms on shore.</p>

<p id="id01126">As soon as I was dressed, I made my way to the main lounge.<br/>

It was deserted.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01127">I dove into studying the conchological treasures amassed inside
the glass cases.  I also investigated the huge plant albums that
were filled with the rarest marine herbs, which, although they
were pressed and dried, still kept their wonderful colors.
Among these valuable water plants, I noted various seaweed:
some Cladostephus verticillatus, peacock's tails, fig-leafed caulerpa,
grain-bearing beauty bushes, delicate rosetangle tinted scarlet,
sea colander arranged into fan shapes, mermaid's cups that looked
like the caps of squat mushrooms and for years had been classified
among the zoophytes; in short, a complete series of algae.</p>

<p id="id01128">The entire day passed without my being honored by a visit
from Captain Nemo.  The panels in the lounge didn't open.
Perhaps they didn't want us to get tired of these beautiful things.</p>

<p id="id01129">The Nautilus kept to an east-northeasterly heading, a speed of twelve
miles per hour, and a depth between fifty and sixty meters.</p>

<p id="id01130">Next day, November 10:  the same neglect, the same solitude.
I didn't see a soul from the crew.  Ned and Conseil spent
the better part of the day with me.  They were astonished at
the captain's inexplicable absence.  Was this eccentric man ill?
Did he want to change his plans concerning us?</p>

<p id="id01131">But after all, as Conseil noted, we enjoyed complete freedom,
we were daintily and abundantly fed.  Our host had kept to the terms
of his agreement.  We couldn't complain, and moreover the very
uniqueness of our situation had such generous rewards in store for us,
we had no grounds for criticism.</p>

<p id="id01132">That day I started my diary of these adventures, which has enabled me
to narrate them with the most scrupulous accuracy; and one odd detail:
I wrote it on paper manufactured from marine eelgrass.</p>

<p id="id01133">Early in the morning on November 11, fresh air poured through
the Nautilus's interior, informing me that we had returned
to the surface of the ocean to renew our oxygen supply.
I headed for the central companionway and climbed onto the platform.</p>

<p id="id01134">It was six o'clock. I found the weather overcast, the sea gray but calm.<br/>

Hardly a billow.  I hoped to encounter Captain Nemo there—would he come?<br/>

I saw only the helmsman imprisoned in his glass-windowed pilothouse.<br/>

Seated on the ledge furnished by the hull of the skiff, I inhaled<br/>

the sea's salty aroma with great pleasure.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01135">Little by little, the mists were dispersed under the action
of the sun's rays.  The radiant orb cleared the eastern horizon.
Under its gaze, the sea caught on fire like a trail of gunpowder.
Scattered on high, the clouds were colored in bright, wonderfully
shaded hues, and numerous "ladyfingers" warned of daylong winds.*</p>

<p id="id01136">*Author's Note:  "Ladyfingers" are small, thin, white clouds
with ragged edges.</p>

<p id="id01137">But what were mere winds to this Nautilus, which no storms
could intimidate!</p>

<p id="id01138">So I was marveling at this delightful sunrise, so life-giving
and cheerful, when I heard someone climbing onto the platform.</p>

<p id="id01139">I was prepared to greet Captain Nemo, but it was his chief
officer who appeared—whom I had already met during our first
visit with the captain.  He advanced over the platform,
not seeming to notice my presence.  A powerful spyglass to his eye,
he scrutinized every point of the horizon with the utmost care.
Then, his examination over, he approached the hatch and pronounced
a phrase whose exact wording follows below.  I remember it because,
every morning, it was repeated under the same circumstances.
It ran like this:</p>

<p id="id01140">"Nautron respoc lorni virch."</p>

<p id="id01141">What it meant I was unable to say.</p>

<p id="id01142">These words pronounced, the chief officer went below again.<br/>

I thought the Nautilus was about to resume its underwater navigating.<br/>

So I went down the hatch and back through the gangways to my stateroom.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01143">Five days passed in this way with no change in our situation.
Every morning I climbed onto the platform.  The same phrase was
pronounced by the same individual.  Captain Nemo did not appear.</p>

<p id="id01144">I was pursuing the policy that we had seen the last of him,
when on November 16, while reentering my stateroom with Ned
and Conseil, I found a note addressed to me on the table.</p>

<p id="id01145">I opened it impatiently.  It was written in a script that was clear
and neat but a bit "Old English" in style, its characters reminding
me of German calligraphy.</p>

<p id="id01146">The note was worded as follows:</p>

<p id="id01147">Professor Aronnax</p>

<p id="id01148">Aboard the Nautilus</p>

<p id="id01149">November 16, 1867</p>

<p id="id01150" style="margin-top: 3em">Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax on a hunting trip that
will take place tomorrow morning in his Crespo Island forests.
He hopes nothing will prevent the professor from attending, and he looks
forward with pleasure to the professor's companions joining him.</p>

<h3 id="id01151" style="margin-top: 3em">CAPTAIN NEMO,</h3>

<p id="id01152">Commander of the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id01153" style="margin-top: 3em">"A hunting trip!"  Ned exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01154">"And in his forests on Crespo Island!"  Conseil added.</p>

<p id="id01155">"But does this mean the old boy goes ashore?"  Ned Land went on.</p>

<p id="id01156">"That seems to be the gist of it," I said, rereading the letter.</p>

<p id="id01157">"Well, we've got to accept!" the Canadian answered.<br/>

"Once we're on solid ground, we'll figure out a course of action.<br/>

Besides, it wouldn't pain me to eat a couple slices of fresh venison!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01158">Without trying to reconcile the contradictions between Captain Nemo's
professed horror of continents or islands and his invitation to go
hunting in a forest, I was content to reply:</p>

<p id="id01159">"First let's look into this Crespo Island."</p>

<p id="id01160">I consulted the world map; and in latitude 32 degrees 40'
north and longitude 167 degrees 50' west, I found an islet that had
been discovered in 1801 by Captain Crespo, which old Spanish charts
called Rocca de la Plata, in other words, "Silver Rock."  So we were
about 1,800 miles from our starting point, and by a slight change
of heading, the Nautilus was bringing us back toward the southeast.</p>

<p id="id01161">I showed my companions this small, stray rock in the middle
of the north Pacific.</p>

<p id="id01162">"If Captain Nemo does sometimes go ashore," I told them, "at least
he only picks desert islands!"</p>

<p id="id01163">Ned Land shook his head without replying; then he and Conseil left me.<br/>

After supper was served me by the mute and emotionless steward,<br/>

I fell asleep; but not without some anxieties.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01164">When I woke up the next day, November 17, I sensed that the Nautilus
was completely motionless.  I dressed hurriedly and entered
the main lounge.</p>

<p id="id01165">Captain Nemo was there waiting for me.  He stood up, bowed, and asked
if it suited me to come along.</p>

<p id="id01166">Since he made no allusion to his absence the past eight days,
I also refrained from mentioning it, and I simply answered that my
companions and I were ready to go with him.</p>

<p id="id01167">"Only, sir," I added, "I'll take the liberty of addressing
a question to you."</p>

<p id="id01168">"Address away, Professor Aronnax, and if I'm able to answer, I will."</p>

<p id="id01169">"Well then, captain, how is it that you've severed all ties with
the shore, yet you own forests on Crespo Island?"</p>

<p id="id01170">"Professor," the captain answered me, "these forests of mine
don't bask in the heat and light of the sun.  They aren't
frequented by lions, tigers, panthers, or other quadrupeds.
They're known only to me.  They grow only for me.  These forests
aren't on land, they're actual underwater forests."</p>

<p id="id01171">"Underwater forests!"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01172">"Yes, professor."</p>

<p id="id01173">"And you're offering to take me to them?"</p>

<p id="id01174">"Precisely."</p>

<p id="id01175">"On foot?"</p>

<p id="id01176">"Without getting your feet wet."</p>

<p id="id01177">"While hunting?"</p>

<p id="id01178">"While hunting."</p>

<p id="id01179">"Rifles in hand?"</p>

<p id="id01180">"Rifles in hand."</p>

<p id="id01181">I stared at the Nautilus's commander with an air anything but
flattering to the man.</p>

<p id="id01182">"Assuredly," I said to myself, "he's contracted some mental illness.<br/>

He's had a fit that's lasted eight days and isn't over even yet.<br/>

What a shame!  I liked him better eccentric than insane!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01183">These thoughts were clearly readable on my face; but Captain Nemo
remained content with inviting me to follow him, and I did so like
a man resigned to the worst.</p>

<p id="id01184">We arrived at the dining room, where we found breakfast served.</p>

<p id="id01185">"Professor Aronnax," the captain told me, "I beg you to share
my breakfast without formality.  We can chat while we eat.
Because, although I promised you a stroll in my forests, I made
no pledge to arrange for your encountering a restaurant there.
Accordingly, eat your breakfast like a man who'll probably eat
dinner only when it's extremely late."</p>

<p id="id01186">I did justice to this meal.  It was made up of various fish
and some slices of sea cucumber, that praiseworthy zoophyte,
all garnished with such highly appetizing seaweed as the Porphyra
laciniata and the Laurencia primafetida.  Our beverage consisted
of clear water to which, following the captain's example, I added
some drops of a fermented liquor extracted by the Kamchatka process
from the seaweed known by name as Rhodymenia palmata.</p>

<p id="id01187">At first Captain Nemo ate without pronouncing a single word.<br/>

Then he told me:<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01188">"Professor, when I proposed that you go hunting in my Crespo forests,
you thought I was contradicting myself.  When I informed you that it
was an issue of underwater forests, you thought I'd gone insane.
Professor, you must never make snap judgments about your fellow man."</p>

<p id="id01189">"But, captain, believe me—"</p>

<p id="id01190">"Kindly listen to me, and you'll see if you have grounds for accusing
me of insanity or self-contradiction."</p>

<p id="id01191">"I'm all attention."</p>

<p id="id01192">"Professor, you know as well as I do that a man can live underwater
so long as he carries with him his own supply of breathable air.
For underwater work projects, the workman wears a waterproof suit
with his head imprisoned in a metal capsule, while he receives air
from above by means of force pumps and flow regulators."</p>

<p id="id01193">"That's the standard equipment for a diving suit," I said.</p>

<p id="id01194">"Correct, but under such conditions the man has no freedom.
He's attached to a pump that sends him air through an india-rubber hose;
it's an actual chain that fetters him to the shore, and if we were
to be bound in this way to the Nautilus, we couldn't go far either."</p>

<p id="id01195">"Then how do you break free?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id01196">"We use the Rouquayrol-Denayrouze device, invented by two of your
fellow countrymen but refined by me for my own special uses,
thereby enabling you to risk these new physiological conditions
without suffering any organic disorders.  It consists of a tank
built from heavy sheet iron in which I store air under a pressure
of fifty atmospheres.  This tank is fastened to the back by means
of straps, like a soldier's knapsack.  Its top part forms a box
where the air is regulated by a bellows mechanism and can be
released only at its proper tension.  In the Rouquayrol device
that has been in general use, two india-rubber hoses leave this
box and feed to a kind of tent that imprisons the operator's nose
and mouth; one hose is for the entrance of air to be inhaled,
the other for the exit of air to be exhaled, and the tongue closes
off the former or the latter depending on the breather's needs.
But in my case, since I face considerable pressures at the bottom
of the sea, I needed to enclose my head in a copper sphere,
like those found on standard diving suits, and the two hoses
for inhalation and exhalation now feed to that sphere."</p>

<p id="id01197">"That's perfect, Captain Nemo, but the air you carry must be
quickly depleted; and once it contains no more than 15% oxygen,
it becomes unfit for breathing."</p>

<p id="id01198">"Surely, but as I told you, Professor Aronnax, the Nautilus's
pumps enable me to store air under considerable pressure,
and given this circumstance, the tank on my diving equipment can
supply breathable air for nine or ten hours."</p>

<p id="id01199">"I've no more objections to raise," I replied.  "I'll only
ask you, captain:  how can you light your way at the bottom
of the ocean?"</p>

<p id="id01200">"With the Ruhmkorff device, Professor Aronnax.  If the first
is carried on the back, the second is fastened to the belt.
It consists of a Bunsen battery that I activate not with potassium
dichromate but with sodium.  An induction coil gathers the electricity
generated and directs it to a specially designed lantern.
In this lantern one finds a glass spiral that contains only
a residue of carbon dioxide gas.  When the device is operating,
this gas becomes luminous and gives off a continuous whitish light.
Thus provided for, I breathe and I see."</p>

<p id="id01201">"Captain Nemo, to my every objection you give such crushing answers,
I'm afraid to entertain a single doubt.  However, though I have no
choice but to accept both the Rouquayrol and Ruhmkorff devices,
I'd like to register some reservations about the rifle with which
you'll equip me."</p>

<p id="id01202">"But it isn't a rifle that uses gunpowder," the captain replied.</p>

<p id="id01203">"Then it's an air gun?"</p>

<p id="id01204">"Surely.  How can I make gunpowder on my ship when I have no saltpeter,
sulfur, or charcoal?"</p>

<p id="id01205">"Even so," I replied, "to fire underwater in a medium that's 855 times
denser than air, you'd have to overcome considerable resistance."</p>

<p id="id01206">"That doesn't necessarily follow.  There are certain Fulton-style
guns perfected by the Englishmen Philippe-Coles and Burley,
the Frenchman Furcy, and the Italian Landi; they're equipped
with a special system of airtight fastenings and can fire
in underwater conditions.  But I repeat:  having no gunpowder,
I've replaced it with air at high pressure, which is abundantly
supplied me by the Nautilus's pumps."</p>

<p id="id01207">"But this air must be swiftly depleted."</p>

<p id="id01208">"Well, in a pinch can't my Rouquayrol tank supply me with more?  All I
have to do is draw it from an ad hoc spigot.* Besides, Professor Aronnax,
you'll see for yourself that during these underwater hunting trips,
we make no great expenditure of either air or bullets."</p>

<p id="id01209">*Latin: a spigot "just for that purpose."  Ed.</p>

<p id="id01210">"But it seems to me that in this semidarkness, amid this liquid
that's so dense in comparison to the atmosphere, a gunshot couldn't
carry far and would prove fatal only with difficulty!"</p>

<p id="id01211">"On the contrary, sir, with this rifle every shot is fatal;
and as soon as the animal is hit, no matter how lightly, it falls
as if struck by lightning."</p>

<p id="id01212">"Why?"</p>

<p id="id01213">"Because this rifle doesn't shoot ordinary bullets but little
glass capsules invented by the Austrian chemist Leniebroek,
and I have a considerable supply of them.  These glass capsules
are covered with a strip of steel and weighted with a lead base;
they're genuine little Leyden jars charged with high-voltage electricity.
They go off at the slightest impact, and the animal, no matter
how strong, drops dead.  I might add that these capsules are no
bigger than number 4 shot, and the chamber of any ordinary rifle
could hold ten of them."</p>

<p id="id01214">"I'll quit debating," I replied, getting up from the table.<br/>

"And all that's left is for me to shoulder my rifle.<br/>

So where you go, I'll go."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01215">Captain Nemo led me to the Nautilus's stern, and passing
by Ned and Conseil's cabin, I summoned my two companions,
who instantly followed us.</p>

<p id="id01216">Then we arrived at a cell located within easy access of the engine room;
in this cell we were to get dressed for our stroll.</p>

<h1 id="id01217" style="margin-top: 6em">CHAPTER 16</h1>

<p id="id01218" style="margin-top: 3em">Strolling the Plains</p>

<p id="id01219" style="margin-top: 3em">THIS CELL, properly speaking, was the Nautilus's arsenal and wardrobe.
Hanging from its walls, a dozen diving outfits were waiting for
anybody who wanted to take a stroll.</p>

<p id="id01220">After seeing these, Ned Land exhibited an obvious distaste for the idea
of putting one on.</p>

<p id="id01221">"But my gallant Ned," I told him, "the forests of Crespo Island
are simply underwater forests!"</p>

<p id="id01222">"Oh great!" put in the disappointed harpooner, watching his dreams
of fresh meat fade away.  "And you, Professor Aronnax, are you
going to stick yourself inside these clothes?"</p>

<p id="id01223">"It has to be, Mr. Ned."</p>

<p id="id01224">"Have it your way, sir," the harpooner replied, shrugging his shoulders.
"But speaking for myself, I'll never get into those things unless
they force me!"</p>

<p id="id01225">"No one will force you, Mr. Land," Captain Nemo said.</p>

<p id="id01226">"And is Conseil going to risk it?"  Ned asked.</p>

<p id="id01227">"Where master goes, I go," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id01228">At the captain's summons, two crewmen came to help us put
on these heavy, waterproof clothes, made from seamless india
rubber and expressly designed to bear considerable pressures.
They were like suits of armor that were both yielding and resistant,
you might say.  These clothes consisted of jacket and pants.
The pants ended in bulky footwear adorned with heavy lead soles.
The fabric of the jacket was reinforced with copper mail that shielded
the chest, protected it from the water's pressure, and allowed
the lungs to function freely; the sleeves ended in supple gloves
that didn't impede hand movements.</p>

<p id="id01229">These perfected diving suits, it was easy to see, were a far cry from
such misshapen costumes as the cork breastplates, leather jumpers,
seagoing tunics, barrel helmets, etc., invented and acclaimed
in the 18th century.</p>

<p id="id01230">Conseil and I were soon dressed in these diving suits, as were
Captain Nemo and one of his companions—a herculean type who must
have been prodigiously strong.  All that remained was to encase one's
head in its metal sphere.  But before proceeding with this operation,
I asked the captain for permission to examine the rifles set
aside for us.</p>

<p id="id01231">One of the Nautilus's men presented me with a streamlined rifle
whose butt was boilerplate steel, hollow inside, and of fairly
large dimensions.  This served as a tank for the compressed air,
which a trigger-operated valve could release into the metal chamber.
In a groove where the butt was heaviest, a cartridge clip
held some twenty electric bullets that, by means of a spring,
automatically took their places in the barrel of the rifle.
As soon as one shot had been fired, another was ready to go off.</p>

<p id="id01232" style="margin-top: 4em">"Captain Nemo," I said, "this is an ideal, easy-to-use weapon.
I ask only to put it to the test.  But how will we reach the bottom
of the sea?"</p>

<p id="id01233">"Right now, professor, the Nautilus is aground in ten meters of water,
and we've only to depart."</p>

<p id="id01234">"But how will we set out?"</p>

<p id="id01235">"You'll see."</p>

<p id="id01236">Captain Nemo inserted his cranium into its spherical headgear.
Conseil and I did the same, but not without hearing the Canadian
toss us a sarcastic "happy hunting."  On top, the suit ended in a
collar of threaded copper onto which the metal helmet was screwed.
Three holes, protected by heavy glass, allowed us to see in any
direction with simply a turn of the head inside the sphere.
Placed on our backs, the Rouquayrol device went into operation as soon
as it was in position, and for my part, I could breathe with ease.</p>

<p id="id01237">The Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, my rifle in hand,
I was ready to go forth.  But in all honesty, while imprisoned
in these heavy clothes and nailed to the deck by my lead soles,
it was impossible for me to take a single step.</p>

<p id="id01238">But this circumstance had been foreseen, because I felt
myself propelled into a little room adjoining the wardrobe.
Towed in the same way, my companions went with me.  I heard a door
with watertight seals close after us, and we were surrounded
by profound darkness.</p>

<p id="id01239">After some minutes a sharp hissing reached my ears.
I felt a distinct sensation of cold rising from my feet to my chest.
Apparently a stopcock inside the boat was letting in water
from outside, which overran us and soon filled up the room.
Contrived in the Nautilus's side, a second door then opened.
We were lit by a subdued light.  An instant later our feet were
treading the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p id="id01240">And now, how can I convey the impressions left on me by this stroll
under the waters.  Words are powerless to describe such wonders!
When even the painter's brush can't depict the effects unique to
the liquid element, how can the writer's pen hope to reproduce them?</p>

<p id="id01241">Captain Nemo walked in front, and his companion followed us a few steps
to the rear.  Conseil and I stayed next to each other, as if daydreaming
that through our metal carapaces, a little polite conversation
might still be possible!  Already I no longer felt the bulkiness
of my clothes, footwear, and air tank, nor the weight of the heavy
sphere inside which my head was rattling like an almond in its shell.
Once immersed in water, all these objects lost a part of their
weight equal to the weight of the liquid they displaced, and thanks
to this law of physics discovered by Archimedes, I did just fine.
I was no longer an inert mass, and I had, comparatively speaking,
great freedom of movement.</p>

<p id="id01242">Lighting up the seafloor even thirty feet beneath the surface
of the ocean, the sun astonished me with its power.  The solar rays
easily crossed this aqueous mass and dispersed its dark colors.
I could easily distinguish objects 100 meters away.  Farther on,
the bottom was tinted with fine shades of ultramarine; then, off in
the distance, it turned blue and faded in the midst of a hazy darkness.
Truly, this water surrounding me was just a kind of air,
denser than the atmosphere on land but almost as transparent.
Above me I could see the calm surface of the ocean.</p>

<p id="id01243">We were walking on sand that was fine-grained and smooth,
not wrinkled like beach sand, which preserves the impressions
left by the waves.  This dazzling carpet was a real mirror,
throwing back the sun's rays with startling intensity.  The outcome:
an immense vista of reflections that penetrated every liquid molecule.
Will anyone believe me if I assert that at this thirty-foot depth,
I could see as if it was broad daylight?</p>

<p id="id01244">For a quarter of an hour, I trod this blazing sand, which was
strewn with tiny crumbs of seashell.  Looming like a long reef,
the Nautilus's hull disappeared little by little, but when night fell
in the midst of the waters, the ship's beacon would surely facilitate
our return on board, since its rays carried with perfect distinctness.
This effect is difficult to understand for anyone who has never
seen light beams so sharply defined on shore.  There the dust that
saturates the air gives such rays the appearance of a luminous fog;
but above water as well as underwater, shafts of electric light
are transmitted with incomparable clarity.</p>

<p id="id01245">Meanwhile we went ever onward, and these vast plains of sand
seemed endless.  My hands parted liquid curtains that closed again
behind me, and my footprints faded swiftly under the water's pressure.</p>

<p id="id01246">Soon, scarcely blurred by their distance from us, the forms of some
objects took shape before my eyes.  I recognized the lower slopes
of some magnificent rocks carpeted by the finest zoophyte specimens,
and right off, I was struck by an effect unique to this medium.</p>

<p id="id01247">By then it was ten o'clock in the morning.  The sun's rays hit
the surface of the waves at a fairly oblique angle, decomposing by
refraction as though passing through a prism; and when this light came
in contact with flowers, rocks, buds, seashells, and polyps, the edges
of these objects were shaded with all seven hues of the solar spectrum.
This riot of rainbow tints was a wonder, a feast for the eyes:
a genuine kaleidoscope of red, green, yellow, orange, violet, indigo,
and blue; in short, the whole palette of a color-happy painter!
If only I had been able to share with Conseil the intense sensations
rising in my brain, competing with him in exclamations of wonderment!
If only I had known, like Captain Nemo and his companion,
how to exchange thoughts by means of prearranged signals!
So, for lack of anything better, I talked to myself:  I declaimed
inside this copper box that topped my head, spending more air
on empty words than was perhaps advisable.</p>

<p id="id01248">Conseil, like me, had stopped before this splendid sight.
Obviously, in the presence of these zoophyte and mollusk specimens,
the fine lad was classifying his head off.  Polyps and echinoderms
abounded on the seafloor:  various isis coral, cornularian coral
living in isolation, tufts of virginal genus Oculina formerly
known by the name "white coral," prickly fungus coral in the shape
of mushrooms, sea anemone holding on by their muscular disks,
providing a literal flowerbed adorned by jellyfish from the genus
Porpita wearing collars of azure tentacles, and starfish that spangled
the sand, including veinlike feather stars from the genus Asterophyton
that were like fine lace embroidered by the hands of water nymphs,
their festoons swaying to the faint undulations caused by our walking.
It filled me with real chagrin to crush underfoot the gleaming
mollusk samples that littered the seafloor by the thousands:
concentric comb shells, hammer shells, coquina (seashells that actually
hop around), top-shell snails, red helmet shells, angel-wing conchs,
sea hares, and so many other exhibits from this inexhaustible ocean.
But we had to keep walking, and we went forward while overhead there
scudded schools of Portuguese men-of-war that let their ultramarine
tentacles drift in their wakes, medusas whose milky white or dainty
pink parasols were festooned with azure tassels and shaded us from
the sun's rays, plus jellyfish of the species Pelagia panopyra that,
in the dark, would have strewn our path with phosphorescent glimmers!</p>

<p id="id01249">All these wonders I glimpsed in the space of a quarter of a mile,
barely pausing, following Captain Nemo whose gestures kept beckoning
me onward.  Soon the nature of the seafloor changed.  The plains of sand
were followed by a bed of that viscous slime Americans call "ooze,"
which is composed exclusively of seashells rich in limestone or silica.
Then we crossed a prairie of algae, open-sea plants that the waters
hadn't yet torn loose, whose vegetation grew in wild profusion.
Soft to the foot, these densely textured lawns would have
rivaled the most luxuriant carpets woven by the hand of man.
But while this greenery was sprawling under our steps, it didn't
neglect us overhead.  The surface of the water was crisscrossed
by a floating arbor of marine plants belonging to that superabundant
algae family that numbers more than 2,000 known species.
I saw long ribbons of fucus drifting above me, some globular,
others tubular:  Laurencia, Cladostephus with the slenderest foliage,
Rhodymenia palmata resembling the fan shapes of cactus.
I observed that green-colored plants kept closer to the surface
of the sea, while reds occupied a medium depth, which left
blacks and browns in charge of designing gardens and flowerbeds
in the ocean's lower strata.</p>

<p id="id01250">These algae are a genuine prodigy of creation, one of the wonders
of world flora.  This family produces both the biggest and smallest
vegetables in the world.  Because, just as 40,000 near-invisible
buds have been counted in one five-square-millimeter space, so also
have fucus plants been gathered that were over 500 meters long!</p>

<p id="id01251">We had been gone from the Nautilus for about an hour and a half.
It was almost noon.  I spotted this fact in the perpendicularity
of the sun's rays, which were no longer refracted.  The magic
of these solar colors disappeared little by little, with emerald
and sapphire shades vanishing from our surroundings altogether.
We walked with steady steps that rang on the seafloor with
astonishing intensity.  The tiniest sounds were transmitted
with a speed to which the ear is unaccustomed on shore.
In fact, water is a better conductor of sound than air, and under
the waves noises carry four times as fast.</p>

<p id="id01252">Just then the seafloor began to slope sharply downward.
The light took on a uniform hue.  We reached a depth of 100 meters,
by which point we were undergoing a pressure of ten atmospheres.
But my diving clothes were built along such lines that I never
suffered from this pressure.  I felt only a certain tightness in
the joints of my fingers, and even this discomfort soon disappeared.
As for the exhaustion bound to accompany a two-hour stroll
in such unfamiliar trappings—it was nil.  Helped by the water,
my movements were executed with startling ease.</p>

<p id="id01253">Arriving at this 300-foot depth, I still detected the sun's rays,
but just barely.  Their intense brilliance had been followed
by a reddish twilight, a midpoint between day and night.
But we could see well enough to find our way, and it still wasn't
necessary to activate the Ruhmkorff device.</p>

<p id="id01254">Just then Captain Nemo stopped.  He waited until I joined him,
then he pointed a finger at some dark masses outlined in the shadows
a short distance away.</p>

<p id="id01255">"It's the forest of Crespo Island," I thought; and I was not mistaken.</p>

<h1 id="id01256" style="margin-top: 5em">CHAPTER 17</h1>

<p id="id01257" style="margin-top: 3em">An Underwater Forest</p>

<p id="id01258" style="margin-top: 3em">WE HAD FINALLY arrived on the outskirts of this forest,
surely one of the finest in Captain Nemo's immense domains.
He regarded it as his own and had laid the same claim to it that,
in the first days of the world, the first men had to their forests
on land.  Besides, who else could dispute his ownership of this
underwater property?  What other, bolder pioneer would come,
ax in hand, to clear away its dark underbrush?</p>

<p id="id01259">This forest was made up of big treelike plants, and when we
entered beneath their huge arches, my eyes were instantly struck
by the unique arrangement of their branches—an arrangement that I
had never before encountered.</p>

<p id="id01260">None of the weeds carpeting the seafloor, none of the branches bristling
from the shrubbery, crept, or leaned, or stretched on a horizontal plane.
They all rose right up toward the surface of the ocean.
Every filament or ribbon, no matter how thin, stood ramrod straight.
Fucus plants and creepers were growing in stiff perpendicular lines,
governed by the density of the element that generated them.
After I parted them with my hands, these otherwise motionless
plants would shoot right back to their original positions.
It was the regime of verticality.</p>

<p id="id01261">I soon grew accustomed to this bizarre arrangement, likewise to
the comparative darkness surrounding us.  The seafloor in this forest
was strewn with sharp chunks of stone that were hard to avoid.
Here the range of underwater flora seemed pretty comprehensive to me,
as well as more abundant than it might have been in the arctic
or tropical zones, where such exhibits are less common.
But for a few minutes I kept accidentally confusing the two kingdoms,
mistaking zoophytes for water plants, animals for vegetables.
And who hasn't made the same blunder?  Flora and fauna are so closely
associated in the underwater world!</p>

<p id="id01262">I observed that all these exhibits from the vegetable kingdom
were attached to the seafloor by only the most makeshift methods.
They had no roots and didn't care which solid objects
secured them, sand, shells, husks, or pebbles; they didn't
ask their hosts for sustenance, just a point of purchase.
These plants are entirely self-propagating, and the principle of
their existence lies in the water that sustains and nourishes them.
In place of leaves, most of them sprouted blades of unpredictable shape,
which were confined to a narrow gamut of colors consisting only
of pink, crimson, green, olive, tan, and brown.  There I saw again,
but not yet pressed and dried like the Nautilus's specimens,
some peacock's tails spread open like fans to stir up a cooling breeze,
scarlet rosetangle, sea tangle stretching out their young and
edible shoots, twisting strings of kelp from the genus Nereocystis
that bloomed to a height of fifteen meters, bouquets of mermaid's cups
whose stems grew wider at the top, and a number of other open-sea plants,
all without flowers.  "It's an odd anomaly in this bizarre element!"
as one witty naturalist puts it.  "The animal kingdom blossoms,
and the vegetable kingdom doesn't!"</p>

<p id="id01263">These various types of shrubbery were as big as trees in the
temperate zones; in the damp shade between them, there were clustered
actual bushes of moving flowers, hedges of zoophytes in which there
grew stony coral striped with twisting furrows, yellowish sea anemone
from the genus Caryophylia with translucent tentacles, plus anemone
with grassy tufts from the genus Zoantharia; and to complete the illusion,
minnows flitted from branch to branch like a swarm of hummingbirds,
while there rose underfoot, like a covey of snipe, yellow fish
from the genus Lepisocanthus with bristling jaws and sharp scales,
flying gurnards, and pinecone fish.</p>

<p id="id01264">Near one o'clock, Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt.
Speaking for myself, I was glad to oblige, and we stretched out
beneath an arbor of winged kelp, whose long thin tendrils stood
up like arrows.</p>

<p id="id01265">This short break was a delight.  It lacked only the charm
of conversation.  But it was impossible to speak, impossible to reply.
I simply nudged my big copper headpiece against Conseil's headpiece.
I saw a happy gleam in the gallant lad's eyes, and to communicate
his pleasure, he jiggled around inside his carapace in the
world's silliest way.</p>

<p id="id01266">After four hours of strolling, I was quite astonished not
to feel any intense hunger.  What kept my stomach in such a
good mood I'm unable to say.  But, in exchange, I experienced
that irresistible desire for sleep that comes over every diver.
Accordingly, my eyes soon closed behind their heavy glass windows
and I fell into an uncontrollable doze, which until then I had been
able to fight off only through the movements of our walking.
Captain Nemo and his muscular companion were already stretched
out in this clear crystal, setting us a fine naptime example.</p>

<p id="id01267">How long I was sunk in this torpor I cannot estimate; but when I awoke,
it seemed as if the sun were settling toward the horizon.
Captain Nemo was already up, and I had started to stretch my limbs,
when an unexpected apparition brought me sharply to my feet.</p>

<p id="id01268">A few paces away, a monstrous, meter-high sea spider was
staring at me with beady eyes, poised to spring at me.
Although my diving suit was heavy enough to protect me from this
animal's bites, I couldn't keep back a shudder of horror.
Just then Conseil woke up, together with the Nautilus's sailor.
Captain Nemo alerted his companion to this hideous crustacean,
which a swing of the rifle butt quickly brought down, and I watched
the monster's horrible legs writhing in dreadful convulsions.</p>

<p id="id01269">This encounter reminded me that other, more daunting animals must
be lurking in these dark reaches, and my diving suit might not be
adequate protection against their attacks.  Such thoughts hadn't
previously crossed my mind, and I was determined to keep on my guard.
Meanwhile I had assumed this rest period would be the turning point
in our stroll, but I was mistaken; and instead of heading back
to the Nautilus, Captain Nemo continued his daring excursion.</p>

<p id="id01270">The seafloor kept sinking, and its significantly steeper slope took
us to greater depths.  It must have been nearly three o'clock when we
reached a narrow valley gouged between high, vertical walls and
located 150 meters down.  Thanks to the perfection of our equipment,
we had thus gone ninety meters below the limit that nature had,
until then, set on man's underwater excursions.</p>

<p id="id01271">I say 150 meters, although I had no instruments for estimating
this distance.  But I knew that the sun's rays, even in
the clearest seas, could reach no deeper.  So at precisely
this point the darkness became profound.  Not a single object
was visible past ten paces.  Consequently, I had begun to grope
my way when suddenly I saw the glow of an intense white light.
Captain Nemo had just activated his electric device.
His companion did likewise.  Conseil and I followed suit.
By turning a switch, I established contact between the induction
coil and the glass spiral, and the sea, lit up by our four lanterns,
was illuminated for a radius of twenty-five meters.</p>

<p id="id01272">Captain Nemo continued to plummet into the dark depths of this forest,
whose shrubbery grew ever more sparse.  I observed that vegetable
life was disappearing more quickly than animal life.  The open-sea
plants had already left behind the increasingly arid seafloor,
where a prodigious number of animals were still swarming:
zoophytes, articulates, mollusks, and fish.</p>

<p id="id01273">While we were walking, I thought the lights of our Ruhmkorff devices
would automatically attract some inhabitants of these dark strata.
But if they did approach us, at least they kept at a distance regrettable
from the hunter's standpoint.  Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop
and take aim with his rifle; then, after sighting down its barrel
for a few seconds, he would straighten up and resume his walk.</p>

<p id="id01274">Finally, at around four o'clock, this marvelous excursion came to an end.
A wall of superb rocks stood before us, imposing in its sheer mass:
a pile of gigantic stone blocks, an enormous granite cliffside pitted
with dark caves but not offering a single gradient we could climb up.
This was the underpinning of Crespo Island.  This was land.</p>

<p id="id01275">The captain stopped suddenly.  A gesture from him brought us to a halt,
and however much I wanted to clear this wall, I had to stop.
Here ended the domains of Captain Nemo.  He had no desire to pass
beyond them.  Farther on lay a part of the globe he would no
longer tread underfoot.</p>

<p id="id01276">Our return journey began.  Captain Nemo resumed the lead
in our little band, always heading forward without hesitation.
I noted that we didn't follow the same path in returning to
the Nautilus.  This new route, very steep and hence very arduous,
quickly took us close to the surface of the sea.  But this
return to the upper strata wasn't so sudden that decompression
took place too quickly, which could have led to serious organic
disorders and given us those internal injuries so fatal to divers.
With great promptness, the light reappeared and grew stronger;
and the refraction of the sun, already low on the horizon, again ringed
the edges of various objects with the entire color spectrum.</p>

<p id="id01277">At a depth of ten meters, we walked amid a swarm of small fish from
every species, more numerous than birds in the air, more agile too;
but no aquatic game worthy of a gunshot had yet been offered
to our eyes.</p>

<p id="id01278">Just then I saw the captain's weapon spring to his shoulder
and track a moving object through the bushes.  A shot went off,
I heard a faint hissing, and an animal dropped a few paces away,
literally struck by lightning.</p>

<p id="id01279">It was a magnificent sea otter from the genus Enhydra, the only
exclusively marine quadruped.  One and a half meters long, this otter
had to be worth a good high price.  Its coat, chestnut brown above and
silver below, would have made one of those wonderful fur pieces so much
in demand in the Russian and Chinese markets; the fineness and luster
of its pelt guaranteed that it would go for at least 2,000 francs.
I was full of wonderment at this unusual mammal, with its circular
head adorned by short ears, its round eyes, its white whiskers
like those on a cat, its webbed and clawed feet, its bushy tail.
Hunted and trapped by fishermen, this valuable carnivore has become
extremely rare, and it takes refuge chiefly in the northernmost
parts of the Pacific, where in all likelihood its species will soon
be facing extinction.</p>

<p id="id01280">Captain Nemo's companion picked up the animal, loaded it on his shoulder,
and we took to the trail again.</p>

<p id="id01281">For an hour plains of sand unrolled before our steps.
Often the seafloor rose to within two meters of the surface of the water.
I could then see our images clearly mirrored on the underside
of the waves, but reflected upside down:  above us there appeared
an identical band that duplicated our every movement and gesture;
in short, a perfect likeness of the quartet near which it walked,
but with heads down and feet in the air.</p>

<p id="id01282">Another unusual effect.  Heavy clouds passed above us, forming and
fading swiftly.  But after thinking it over, I realized that these
so-called clouds were caused simply by the changing densities of
the long ground swells, and I even spotted the foaming "white caps"
that their breaking crests were proliferating over the surface
of the water.  Lastly, I couldn't help seeing the actual shadows
of large birds passing over our heads, swiftly skimming the surface
of the sea.</p>

<p id="id01283">On this occasion I witnessed one of the finest gunshots ever to
thrill the marrow of a hunter.  A large bird with a wide wingspan,
quite clearly visible, approached and hovered over us.  When it was just a
few meters above the waves, Captain Nemo's companion took aim and fired.
The animal dropped, electrocuted, and its descent brought it within
reach of our adroit hunter, who promptly took possession of it.
It was an albatross of the finest species, a wonderful specimen
of these open-sea fowl.</p>

<p id="id01284">This incident did not interrupt our walk.  For two hours we were
sometimes led over plains of sand, sometimes over prairies of seaweed
that were quite arduous to cross.  In all honesty, I was dead tired
by the time I spotted a hazy glow half a mile away, cutting through
the darkness of the waters.  It was the Nautilus's beacon.
Within twenty minutes we would be on board, and there I could
breathe easy again—because my tank's current air supply seemed
to be quite low in oxygen.  But I was reckoning without an encounter
that slightly delayed our arrival.</p>

<p id="id01285">I was lagging behind some twenty paces when I saw Captain Nemo suddenly
come back toward me.  With his powerful hands he sent me buckling
to the ground, while his companion did the same to Conseil.  At first I
didn't know what to make of this sudden assault, but I was reassured
to observe the captain lying motionless beside me.</p>

<p id="id01286">I was stretched out on the seafloor directly beneath some bushes of algae,
when I raised my head and spied two enormous masses hurtling by,
throwing off phosphorescent glimmers.</p>

<p id="id01287">My blood turned cold in my veins!  I saw that we were under threat from
a fearsome pair of sharks.  They were blue sharks, dreadful man-eaters
with enormous tails, dull, glassy stares, and phosphorescent matter
oozing from holes around their snouts.  They were like monstrous
fireflies that could thoroughly pulverize a man in their iron jaws!
I don't know if Conseil was busy with their classification,
but as for me, I looked at their silver bellies, their fearsome
mouths bristling with teeth, from a viewpoint less than scientific—
more as a victim than as a professor of natural history.</p>

<p id="id01288">Luckily these voracious animals have poor eyesight.  They went
by without noticing us, grazing us with their brownish fins;
and miraculously, we escaped a danger greater than encountering
a tiger deep in the jungle.</p>

<p id="id01289">Half an hour later, guided by its electric trail, we reached
the Nautilus.  The outside door had been left open, and Captain Nemo
closed it after we reentered the first cell.  Then he pressed a button.
I heard pumps operating within the ship, I felt the water lowering
around me, and in a few moments the cell was completely empty.
The inside door opened, and we passed into the wardrobe.</p>

<p id="id01290">There our diving suits were removed, not without difficulty;
and utterly exhausted, faint from lack of food and rest, I repaired
to my stateroom, full of wonder at this startling excursion on
the bottom of the sea.</p>
