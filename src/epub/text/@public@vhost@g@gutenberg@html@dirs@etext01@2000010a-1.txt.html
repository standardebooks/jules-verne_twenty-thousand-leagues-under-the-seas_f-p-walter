<p id="id00209" style="margin-top: 3em">The Pros and Cons</p>

<p id="id00210" style="margin-top: 3em">DURING THE PERIOD in which these developments were occurring,
I had returned from a scientific undertaking organized to explore
the Nebraska badlands in the United States.  In my capacity as
Assistant Professor at the Paris Museum of Natural History, I had
been attached to this expedition by the French government.
After spending six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New York laden
with valuable collections near the end of March.  My departure
for France was set for early May.  In the meantime, then, I was busy
classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and zoological treasures
when that incident took place with the Scotia.</p>

<p id="id00211">I was perfectly abreast of this question, which was the big news
of the day, and how could I not have been?  I had read and reread every
American and European newspaper without being any farther along.
This mystery puzzled me.  Finding it impossible to form any views,
I drifted from one extreme to the other.  Something was out there,
that much was certain, and any doubting Thomas was invited to place
his finger on the Scotia's wound.</p>

<p id="id00212">When I arrived in New York, the question was at the boiling point.
The hypothesis of a drifting islet or an elusive reef, put forward
by people not quite in their right minds, was completely eliminated.
And indeed, unless this reef had an engine in its belly, how could
it move about with such prodigious speed?</p>

<p id="id00213">Also discredited was the idea of a floating hull or some other
enormous wreckage, and again because of this speed of movement.</p>

<p id="id00214">So only two possible solutions to the question were left,
creating two very distinct groups of supporters:  on one side,
those favoring a monster of colossal strength; on the other,
those favoring an "underwater boat" of tremendous motor power.</p>

<p id="id00215">Now then, although the latter hypothesis was completely admissible,
it couldn't stand up to inquiries conducted in both the New World
and the Old.  That a private individual had such a mechanism at his
disposal was less than probable.  Where and when had he built it,
and how could he have built it in secret?</p>

<p id="id00216">Only some government could own such an engine of destruction,
and in these disaster-filled times, when men tax their ingenuity to
build increasingly powerful aggressive weapons, it was possible that,
unknown to the rest of the world, some nation could have been testing
such a fearsome machine.  The Chassepot rifle led to the torpedo,
and the torpedo has led to this underwater battering ram,
which in turn will lead to the world putting its foot down.
At least I hope it will.</p>

<p id="id00217">But this hypothesis of a war machine collapsed in the face of formal
denials from the various governments.  Since the public interest
was at stake and transoceanic travel was suffering, the sincerity
of these governments could not be doubted.  Besides, how could
the assembly of this underwater boat have escaped public notice?
Keeping a secret under such circumstances would be difficult enough
for an individual, and certainly impossible for a nation whose
every move is under constant surveillance by rival powers.</p>

<p id="id00218">So, after inquiries conducted in England, France, Russia, Prussia,<br/>

Spain, Italy, America, and even Turkey, the hypothesis of an underwater<br/>

Monitor was ultimately rejected.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00219">And so the monster surfaced again, despite the endless witticisms
heaped on it by the popular press, and the human imagination soon
got caught up in the most ridiculous ichthyological fantasies.</p>

<p id="id00220">After I arrived in New York, several people did me the honor
of consulting me on the phenomenon in question.  In France I had
published a two-volume work, in quarto, entitled The Mysteries
of the Great Ocean Depths.  Well received in scholarly circles,
this book had established me as a specialist in this pretty obscure field
of natural history.  My views were in demand.  As long as I could deny
the reality of the business, I confined myself to a flat "no comment."
But soon, pinned to the wall, I had to explain myself straight out.
And in this vein, "the honorable Pierre Aronnax, Professor at
the Paris Museum," was summoned by The New York Herald to formulate
his views no matter what.</p>

<p id="id00221">I complied.  Since I could no longer hold my tongue, I let it wag.<br/>

I discussed the question in its every aspect, both political<br/>

and scientific, and this is an excerpt from the well-padded article<br/>

I published in the issue of April 30.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00222">"Therefore," I wrote, "after examining these different hypotheses one
by one, we are forced, every other supposition having been refuted,
to accept the existence of an extremely powerful marine animal.</p>

<p id="id00223">"The deepest parts of the ocean are totally unknown to us.
No soundings have been able to reach them.  What goes on in
those distant depths?  What creatures inhabit, or could inhabit,
those regions twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface
of the water?  What is the constitution of these animals?
It's almost beyond conjecture.</p>

<p id="id00224">"However, the solution to this problem submitted to me can take
the form of a choice between two alternatives.</p>

<p id="id00225">"Either we know every variety of creature populating our planet,
or we do not.</p>

<p id="id00226">"If we do not know every one of them, if nature still keeps
ichthyological secrets from us, nothing is more admissible than to accept
the existence of fish or cetaceans of new species or even new genera,
animals with a basically 'cast-iron' constitution that inhabit
strata beyond the reach of our soundings, and which some development
or other, an urge or a whim if you prefer, can bring to the upper
level of the ocean for long intervals.</p>

<p id="id00227">"If, on the other hand, we do know every living species, we must
look for the animal in question among those marine creatures
already cataloged, and in this event I would be inclined to accept
the existence of a giant narwhale.</p>

<p id="id00228">"The common narwhale, or sea unicorn, often reaches a length of
sixty feet.  Increase its dimensions fivefold or even tenfold, then give
this cetacean a strength in proportion to its size while enlarging
its offensive weapons, and you have the animal we're looking for.
It would have the proportions determined by the officers of the Shannon,
the instrument needed to perforate the Scotia, and the power
to pierce a steamer's hull.</p>

<p id="id00229">"In essence, the narwhale is armed with a sort of ivory sword,
or lance, as certain naturalists have expressed it.
It's a king-sized tooth as hard as steel.  Some of these teeth have
been found buried in the bodies of baleen whales, which the narwhale
attacks with invariable success.  Others have been wrenched,
not without difficulty, from the undersides of vessels that narwhales
have pierced clean through, as a gimlet pierces a wine barrel.
The museum at the Faculty of Medicine in Paris owns one of these
tusks with a length of 2.25 meters and a width at its base
of forty-eight centimeters!</p>

<p id="id00230">"All right then!  Imagine this weapon to be ten times stronger and
the animal ten times more powerful, launch it at a speed of twenty
miles per hour, multiply its mass times its velocity, and you get
just the collision we need to cause the specified catastrophe.</p>

<p id="id00231">"So, until information becomes more abundant, I plump for a sea
unicorn of colossal dimensions, no longer armed with a mere lance
but with an actual spur, like ironclad frigates or those warships called
'rams,' whose mass and motor power it would possess simultaneously.</p>

<p id="id00232">"This inexplicable phenomenon is thus explained away—unless it's
something else entirely, which, despite everything that has
been sighted, studied, explored and experienced, is still possible!"</p>

<p id="id00233">These last words were cowardly of me; but as far as I could,
I wanted to protect my professorial dignity and not lay myself open
to laughter from the Americans, who when they do laugh, laugh raucously.
I had left myself a loophole.  Yet deep down, I had accepted
the existence of "the monster."</p>

<p id="id00234">My article was hotly debated, causing a fine old uproar.
It rallied a number of supporters.  Moreover, the solution
it proposed allowed for free play of the imagination.
The human mind enjoys impressive visions of unearthly creatures.
Now then, the sea is precisely their best medium, the only setting
suitable for the breeding and growing of such giants—next to which
such land animals as elephants or rhinoceroses are mere dwarves.
The liquid masses support the largest known species of mammals and perhaps
conceal mollusks of incomparable size or crustaceans too frightful
to contemplate, such as 100-meter lobsters or crabs weighing 200
metric tons!  Why not?  Formerly, in prehistoric days, land animals
(quadrupeds, apes, reptiles, birds) were built on a gigantic scale.
Our Creator cast them using a colossal mold that time has gradually
made smaller.  With its untold depths, couldn't the sea keep alive
such huge specimens of life from another age, this sea that never
changes while the land masses undergo almost continuous alteration?
Couldn't the heart of the ocean hide the last-remaining
varieties of these titanic species, for whom years are centuries
and centuries millennia?</p>

<p id="id00235">But I mustn't let these fantasies run away with me!  Enough of these
fairy tales that time has changed for me into harsh realities.
I repeat:  opinion had crystallized as to the nature of this phenomenon,
and the public accepted without argument the existence of a prodigious
creature that had nothing in common with the fabled sea serpent.</p>

<p id="id00236">Yet if some saw it purely as a scientific problem to be solved,
more practical people, especially in America and England,
were determined to purge the ocean of this daunting monster, to insure
the safety of transoceanic travel.  The industrial and commercial
newspapers dealt with the question chiefly from this viewpoint.
The Shipping &amp; Mercantile Gazette, the Lloyd's List, France's Packetboat
and Maritime &amp; Colonial Review, all the rags devoted to
insurance companies—who threatened to raise their premium rates—
were unanimous on this point.</p>

<p id="id00237">Public opinion being pronounced, the States of the Union were
the first in the field.  In New York preparations were under way for
an expedition designed to chase this narwhale.  A high-speed frigate,
the Abraham Lincoln, was fitted out for putting to sea as soon
as possible.  The naval arsenals were unlocked for Commander Farragut,
who pressed energetically forward with the arming of his frigate.</p>

<p id="id00238">But, as it always happens, just when a decision had been made to chase
the monster, the monster put in no further appearances.  For two months
nobody heard a word about it.  Not a single ship encountered it.
Apparently the unicorn had gotten wise to these plots being woven
around it.  People were constantly babbling about the creature,
even via the Atlantic Cable!  Accordingly, the wags claimed that this
slippery rascal had waylaid some passing telegram and was making
the most of it.</p>

<p id="id00239">So the frigate was equipped for a far-off voyage and armed
with fearsome fishing gear, but nobody knew where to steer it.
And impatience grew until, on June 2, word came that the Tampico,
a steamer on the San Francisco line sailing from California to Shanghai,
had sighted the animal again, three weeks before in the northerly
seas of the Pacific.</p>

<p id="id00240">This news caused intense excitement.  Not even a 24-hour breather was
granted to Commander Farragut.  His provisions were loaded on board.
His coal bunkers were overflowing.  Not a crewman was missing
from his post.  To cast off, he needed only to fire and stoke
his furnaces!  Half a day's delay would have been unforgivable!
But Commander Farragut wanted nothing more than to go forth.</p>

<p id="id00241">I received a letter three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left
its Brooklyn pier;* the letter read as follows:</p>

<p id="id00242">*Author's Note:  A pier is a type of wharf expressly set aside
for an individual vessel.</p>

<p id="id00243">Pierre Aronnax</p>

<p id="id00244">Professor at the Paris Museum</p>

<p id="id00245">Fifth Avenue Hotel</p>

<p id="id00246">New York</p>

<p id="id00247">Sir:</p>

<p id="id00248">If you would like to join the expedition on the Abraham Lincoln,
the government of the Union will be pleased to regard you as France's
representative in this undertaking.  Commander Farragut has a cabin
at your disposal.</p>

<p id="id00249">Very cordially yours,</p>

<h5 id="id00250">J. B. HOBSON,</h5>

<p id="id00251">Secretary of the Navy.</p>

<h1 id="id00252" style="margin-top: 7em">CHAPTER 3</h1>

<p id="id00253" style="margin-top: 3em">As Master Wishes</p>

<p id="id00254" style="margin-top: 3em">THREE SECONDS before the arrival of J. B. Hobson's letter,
I no more dreamed of chasing the unicorn than of trying for
the Northwest Passage.  Three seconds after reading this letter
from the honorable Secretary of the Navy, I understood at last that
my true vocation, my sole purpose in life, was to hunt down this
disturbing monster and rid the world of it.</p>

<p id="id00255">Even so, I had just returned from an arduous journey, exhausted and badly
needing a rest.  I wanted nothing more than to see my country again,
my friends, my modest quarters by the Botanical Gardens,
my dearly beloved collections!  But now nothing could hold me back.
I forgot everything else, and without another thought of exhaustion,
friends, or collections, I accepted the American government's offer.</p>

<p id="id00256">"Besides," I mused, "all roads lead home to Europe, and our unicorn
may be gracious enough to take me toward the coast of France!  That fine
animal may even let itself be captured in European seas—as a personal
favor to me—and I'll bring back to the Museum of Natural History
at least half a meter of its ivory lance!"</p>

<p id="id00257">But in the meantime I would have to look for this narwhale in
the northern Pacific Ocean; which meant returning to France by way
of the Antipodes.</p>

<p id="id00258">"Conseil!"  I called in an impatient voice.</p>

<p id="id00259">Conseil was my manservant.  A devoted lad who went with me on all
my journeys; a gallant Flemish boy whom I genuinely liked and who
returned the compliment; a born stoic, punctilious on principle,
habitually hardworking, rarely startled by life's surprises,
very skillful with his hands, efficient in his every duty, and despite
his having a name that means "counsel," never giving advice—
not even the unsolicited kind!</p>

<p id="id00260">From rubbing shoulders with scientists in our little universe
by the Botanical Gardens, the boy had come to know a thing or two.
In Conseil I had a seasoned specialist in biological classification,
an enthusiast who could run with acrobatic agility up and down
the whole ladder of branches, groups, classes, subclasses,
orders, families, genera, subgenera, species, and varieties.
But there his science came to a halt.  Classifying was everything
to him, so he knew nothing else.  Well versed in the theory
of classification, he was poorly versed in its practical application,
and I doubt that he could tell a sperm whale from a baleen whale!
And yet, what a fine, gallant lad!</p>

<p id="id00261">For the past ten years, Conseil had gone with me wherever
science beckoned.  Not once did he comment on the length or the hardships
of a journey.  Never did he object to buckling up his suitcase for any
country whatever, China or the Congo, no matter how far off it was.
He went here, there, and everywhere in perfect contentment.
Moreover, he enjoyed excellent health that defied all ailments,
owned solid muscles, but hadn't a nerve in him, not a sign of nerves—
the mental type, I mean.</p>

<p id="id00262">The lad was thirty years old, and his age to that of his employer
was as fifteen is to twenty.  Please forgive me for this underhanded
way of admitting I had turned forty.</p>

<p id="id00263">But Conseil had one flaw.  He was a fanatic on formality,
and he only addressed me in the third person—to the point where
it got tiresome.</p>

<p id="id00264">"Conseil!"  I repeated, while feverishly beginning my preparations
for departure.</p>

<p id="id00265">To be sure, I had confidence in this devoted lad.  Ordinarily, I never
asked whether or not it suited him to go with me on my journeys;
but this time an expedition was at issue that could drag on indefinitely,
a hazardous undertaking whose purpose was to hunt an animal that could
sink a frigate as easily as a walnut shell!  There was good reason
to stop and think, even for the world's most emotionless man.
What would Conseil say?</p>

<p id="id00266">"Conseil!"  I called a third time.</p>

<p id="id00267">Conseil appeared.</p>

<p id="id00268">"Did master summon me?" he said, entering.</p>

<p id="id00269">"Yes, my boy.  Get my things ready, get yours ready.<br/>

We're departing in two hours."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00270">"As master wishes," Conseil replied serenely.</p>

<p id="id00271">"We haven't a moment to lose.  Pack as much into my trunk as you can,
my traveling kit, my suits, shirts, and socks, don't bother counting,
just squeeze it all in—and hurry!"</p>

<p id="id00272">"What about master's collections?"  Conseil ventured to observe.</p>

<p id="id00273">"We'll deal with them later."</p>

<p id="id00274">"What!  The archaeotherium, hyracotherium, oreodonts, cheiropotamus,
and master's other fossil skeletons?"</p>

<p id="id00275">"The hotel will keep them for us."</p>

<p id="id00276">"What about master's live babirusa?"</p>

<p id="id00277">"They'll feed it during our absence.  Anyhow, we'll leave instructions
to ship the whole menagerie to France."</p>

<p id="id00278">"Then we aren't returning to Paris?"  Conseil asked.</p>

<p id="id00279">"Yes, we are . . . certainly . . . ," I replied evasively,
"but after we make a detour."</p>

<p id="id00280">"Whatever detour master wishes."</p>

<p id="id00281">"Oh, it's nothing really!  A route slightly less direct, that's all.<br/>

We're leaving on the Abraham Lincoln."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00282">"As master thinks best," Conseil replied placidly.</p>

<p id="id00283">"You see, my friend, it's an issue of the monster,
the notorious narwhale.  We're going to rid the seas of it!
The author of a two-volume work, in quarto, on The Mysteries
of the Great Ocean Depths has no excuse for not setting sail
with Commander Farragut.  It's a glorious mission but also a
dangerous one!  We don't know where it will take us!  These beasts
can be quite unpredictable!  But we're going just the same!
We have a commander who's game for anything!"</p>

<p id="id00284">"What master does, I'll do," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id00285">"But think it over, because I don't want to hide anything from you.<br/>

This is one of those voyages from which people don't always come back!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00286">"As master wishes."</p>

<p id="id00287">A quarter of an hour later, our trunks were ready.  Conseil did
them in a flash, and I was sure the lad hadn't missed a thing,
because he classified shirts and suits as expertly as birds and mammals.</p>

<p id="id00288">The hotel elevator dropped us off in the main vestibule on the mezzanine.
I went down a short stair leading to the ground floor.
I settled my bill at that huge counter that was always under siege
by a considerable crowd.  I left instructions for shipping my containers
of stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, France.  I opened a line
of credit sufficient to cover the babirusa and, Conseil at my heels,
I jumped into a carriage.</p>

<p id="id00289">For a fare of twenty francs, the vehicle went down Broadway
to Union Square, took Fourth Ave. to its junction with Bowery St.,
turned into Katrin St. and halted at Pier 34.  There the Katrin ferry
transferred men, horses, and carriage to Brooklyn, that great New York
annex located on the left bank of the East River, and in a few
minutes we arrived at the wharf next to which the Abraham Lincoln
was vomiting torrents of black smoke from its two funnels.</p>

<p id="id00290">Our baggage was immediately carried to the deck of the frigate.
I rushed aboard.  I asked for Commander Farragut.  One of the sailors led
me to the afterdeck, where I stood in the presence of a smart-looking
officer who extended his hand to me.</p>

<p id="id00291">"Professor Pierre Aronnax?" he said to me.</p>

<p id="id00292">"The same," I replied.  "Commander Farragut?"</p>

<p id="id00293">"In person.  Welcome aboard, professor.  Your cabin is waiting for you."</p>

<p id="id00294">I bowed, and letting the commander attend to getting under way,<br/>

I was taken to the cabin that had been set aside for me.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00295">The Abraham Lincoln had been perfectly chosen and fitted out
for its new assignment.  It was a high-speed frigate furnished
with superheating equipment that allowed the tension of its steam
to build to seven atmospheres.  Under this pressure the Abraham Lincoln
reached an average speed of 18.3 miles per hour, a considerable
speed but still not enough to cope with our gigantic cetacean.</p>

<p id="id00296">The frigate's interior accommodations complemented its nautical virtues.
I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was located in the stern
and opened into the officers' mess.</p>

<p id="id00297">"We'll be quite comfortable here," I told Conseil.</p>

<p id="id00298">"With all due respect to master," Conseil replied, "as comfortable
as a hermit crab inside the shell of a whelk."</p>

<p id="id00299">I left Conseil to the proper stowing of our luggage and climbed
on deck to watch the preparations for getting under way.</p>

<p id="id00300">Just then Commander Farragut was giving orders to cast off the last
moorings holding the Abraham Lincoln to its Brooklyn pier.
And so if I'd been delayed by a quarter of an hour or even less,
the frigate would have gone without me, and I would have missed
out on this unearthly, extraordinary, and inconceivable expedition,
whose true story might well meet with some skepticism.</p>

<p id="id00301">But Commander Farragut didn't want to waste a single day,
or even a single hour, in making for those seas where the animal
had just been sighted.  He summoned his engineer.</p>

<p id="id00302">"Are we up to pressure?" he asked the man.</p>

<p id="id00303">"Aye, sir," the engineer replied.</p>

<p id="id00304">"Go ahead, then!"  Commander Farragut called.</p>

<p id="id00305">At this order, which was relayed to the engine by means of a
compressed-air device, the mechanics activated the start-up wheel.
Steam rushed whistling into the gaping valves.  Long horizontal
pistons groaned and pushed the tie rods of the drive shaft.
The blades of the propeller churned the waves with increasing speed,
and the Abraham Lincoln moved out majestically amid a spectator-laden
escort of some 100 ferries and tenders.*</p>

<p id="id00306">*Author's Note:  Tenders are small steamboats that assist
the big liners.</p>

<p id="id00307">The wharves of Brooklyn, and every part of New York bordering
the East River, were crowded with curiosity seekers.
Departing from 500,000 throats, three cheers burst forth in succession.
Thousands of handkerchiefs were waving above these tightly packed masses,
hailing the Abraham</p>

<p id="id00308">Lincoln until it reached the waters of the Hudson River, at the tip
of the long peninsula that forms New York City.</p>

<p id="id00309">The frigate then went along the New Jersey coast—the wonderful
right bank of this river, all loaded down with country homes—
and passed by the forts to salutes from their biggest cannons.
The Abraham Lincoln replied by three times lowering and hoisting
the American flag, whose thirty-nine stars gleamed from the gaff of
the mizzen sail; then, changing speed to take the buoy-marked channel
that curved into the inner bay formed by the spit of Sandy Hook,
it hugged this sand-covered strip of land where thousands of spectators
acclaimed us one more time.</p>

<p id="id00310">The escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate and only
left us when we came abreast of the lightship, whose two signal
lights mark the entrance of the narrows to Upper New York Bay.</p>

<p id="id00311">Three o'clock then sounded.  The harbor pilot went down into his
dinghy and rejoined a little schooner waiting for him to leeward.
The furnaces were stoked; the propeller churned the waves more swiftly;
the frigate skirted the flat, yellow coast of Long Island;
and at eight o'clock in the evening, after the lights of Fire Island
had vanished into the northwest, we ran at full steam onto the dark
waters of the Atlantic.</p>

<h1 id="id00312" style="margin-top: 5em">CHAPTER 4</h1>

<p id="id00313" style="margin-top: 3em">Ned Land</p>

<p id="id00314" style="margin-top: 3em">COMMANDER FARRAGUT was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate
he commanded.  His ship and he were one.  He was its very soul.
On the cetacean question no doubts arose in his mind, and he didn't
allow the animal's existence to be disputed aboard his vessel.
He believed in it as certain pious women believe in the leviathan
from the Book of Job—out of faith, not reason.  The monster existed,
and he had vowed to rid the seas of it.  The man was a sort of
Knight of Rhodes, a latter-day Sir Dieudonné of Gozo, on his way
to fight an encounter with the dragon devastating the island.
Either Commander Farragut would slay the narwhale, or the narwhale
would slay Commander Farragut.  No middle of the road for these two.</p>

<p id="id00315">The ship's officers shared the views of their leader.  They could
be heard chatting, discussing, arguing, calculating the different
chances of an encounter, and observing the vast expanse of the ocean.
Voluntary watches from the crosstrees of the topgallant sail
were self-imposed by more than one who would have cursed such toil
under any other circumstances.  As often as the sun swept over
its daily arc, the masts were populated with sailors whose feet
itched and couldn't hold still on the planking of the deck below!
And the Abraham Lincoln's stempost hadn't even cut the suspected
waters of the Pacific.</p>

<p id="id00316">As for the crew, they only wanted to encounter the unicorn,
harpoon it, haul it on board, and carve it up.  They surveyed the sea
with scrupulous care.  Besides, Commander Farragut had mentioned
that a certain sum of $2,000.00 was waiting for the man who first
sighted the animal, be he cabin boy or sailor, mate or officer.
I'll let the reader decide whether eyes got proper exercise aboard
the Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p id="id00317">As for me, I didn't lag behind the others and I yielded to no
one my share in these daily observations.  Our frigate would
have had fivescore good reasons for renaming itself the Argus,
after that mythological beast with 100 eyes!  The lone rebel among
us was Conseil, who seemed utterly uninterested in the question
exciting us and was out of step with the general enthusiasm on board.</p>

<p id="id00318">As I said, Commander Farragut had carefully equipped his ship
with all the gear needed to fish for a gigantic cetacean.
No whaling vessel could have been better armed.  We had every
known mechanism, from the hand-hurled harpoon, to the blunderbuss
firing barbed arrows, to the duck gun with exploding bullets.
On the forecastle was mounted the latest model breech-loading cannon,
very heavy of barrel and narrow of bore, a weapon that would figure
in the Universal Exhibition of 1867.  Made in America, this valuable
instrument could fire a four-kilogram conical projectile an average
distance of sixteen kilometers without the least bother.</p>

<p id="id00319">So the Abraham Lincoln wasn't lacking in means of destruction.<br/>

But it had better still.  It had Ned Land, the King of Harpooners.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00320">Gifted with uncommon manual ability, Ned Land was a Canadian who had
no equal in his dangerous trade.  Dexterity, coolness, bravery,
and cunning were virtues he possessed to a high degree, and it took
a truly crafty baleen whale or an exceptionally astute sperm whale
to elude the thrusts of his harpoon.</p>

<p id="id00321">Ned Land was about forty years old.  A man of great height—over six
English feet—he was powerfully built, serious in manner, not very
sociable, sometimes headstrong, and quite ill-tempered when crossed.
His looks caught the attention, and above all the strength of his gaze,
which gave a unique emphasis to his facial appearance.</p>

<p id="id00322">Commander Farragut, to my thinking, had made a wise move in hiring
on this man.  With his eye and his throwing arm, he was worth
the whole crew all by himself.  I can do no better than to compare
him with a powerful telescope that could double as a cannon always
ready to fire.</p>

<p id="id00323">To say Canadian is to say French, and as unsociable as
Ned Land was, I must admit he took a definite liking to me.
No doubt it was my nationality that attracted him.
It was an opportunity for him to speak, and for me to hear,
that old Rabelaisian dialect still used in some Canadian provinces.
The harpooner's family originated in Quebec, and they were already
a line of bold fishermen back in the days when this town still
belonged to France.</p>

<p id="id00324">Little by little Ned developed a taste for chatting, and I loved
hearing the tales of his adventures in the polar seas.  He described
his fishing trips and his battles with great natural lyricism.
His tales took on the form of an epic poem, and I felt I was hearing
some Canadian Homer reciting his Iliad of the High Arctic regions.</p>

<p id="id00325">I'm writing of this bold companion as I currently know him.
Because we've become old friends, united in that permanent
comradeship born and cemented during only the most frightful crises!
Ah, my gallant Ned!  I ask only to live 100 years more, the longer
to remember you!</p>

<p id="id00326">And now, what were Ned Land's views on this question of a marine monster?
I must admit that he flatly didn't believe in the unicorn,
and alone on board, he didn't share the general conviction.
He avoided even dealing with the subject, for which one day I felt
compelled to take him to task.</p>

<p id="id00327">During the magnificent evening of June 25—in other words, three weeks
after our departure—the frigate lay abreast of Cabo Blanco,
thirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia.  We had crossed
the Tropic of Capricorn, and the Strait of Magellan opened
less than 700 miles to the south.  Before eight days were out,
the Abraham Lincoln would plow the waves of the Pacific.</p>

<p id="id00328">Seated on the afterdeck, Ned Land and I chatted about one thing
and another, staring at that mysterious sea whose depths to this
day are beyond the reach of human eyes.  Quite naturally,
I led our conversation around to the giant unicorn, and I weighed
our expedition's various chances for success or failure.
Then, seeing that Ned just let me talk without saying much himself,
I pressed him more closely.</p>

<p id="id00329">"Ned," I asked him, "how can you still doubt the reality of this
cetacean we're after?  Do you have any particular reasons for
being so skeptical?"</p>

<p id="id00330">The harpooner stared at me awhile before replying, slapped his
broad forehead in one of his standard gestures, closed his eyes
as if to collect himself, and finally said:</p>

<p id="id00331">"Just maybe, Professor Aronnax."</p>

<p id="id00332">"But Ned, you're a professional whaler, a man familiar with all
the great marine mammals—your mind should easily accept this
hypothesis of an enormous cetacean, and you ought to be the last
one to doubt it under these circumstances!"</p>

<p id="id00333">"That's just where you're mistaken, professor," Ned replied.
"The common man may still believe in fabulous comets crossing
outer space, or in prehistoric monsters living at the earth's core,
but astronomers and geologists don't swallow such fairy tales.
It's the same with whalers.  I've chased plenty of cetaceans,
I've harpooned a good number, I've killed several.  But no matter
how powerful and well armed they were, neither their tails or their
tusks could puncture the sheet-iron plates of a steamer."</p>

<p id="id00334">"Even so, Ned, people mention vessels that narwhale tusks have
run clean through."</p>

<p id="id00335">"Wooden ships maybe," the Canadian replied.  "But I've never seen
the like.  So till I have proof to the contrary, I'll deny that
baleen whales, sperm whales, or unicorns can do any such thing."</p>

<p id="id00336">"Listen to me, Ned—"</p>

<p id="id00337">"No, no, professor.  I'll go along with anything you want except that.<br/>

Some gigantic devilfish maybe . . . ?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00338">"Even less likely, Ned.  The devilfish is merely a mollusk, and even this
name hints at its semiliquid flesh, because it's Latin meaning soft one.
The devilfish doesn't belong to the vertebrate branch, and even if it
were 500 feet long, it would still be utterly harmless to ships
like the Scotia or the Abraham Lincoln.  Consequently, the feats
of krakens or other monsters of that ilk must be relegated to
the realm of fiction."</p>

<p id="id00339">"So, Mr. Naturalist," Ned Land continued in a bantering tone,
"you'll just keep on believing in the existence of some
enormous cetacean . . . ?"</p>

<p id="id00340">"Yes, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction backed by factual logic.
I believe in the existence of a mammal with a powerful constitution,
belonging to the vertebrate branch like baleen whales, sperm whales,
or dolphins, and armed with a tusk made of horn that has
tremendous penetrating power."</p>

<p id="id00341">"Humph!" the harpooner put in, shaking his head with the attitude
of a man who doesn't want to be convinced.</p>

<p id="id00342">"Note well, my fine Canadian," I went on, "if such an animal exists,
if it lives deep in the ocean, if it frequents the liquid strata
located miles beneath the surface of the water, it needs to have
a constitution so solid, it defies all comparison."</p>

<p id="id00343">"And why this powerful constitution?"  Ned asked.</p>

<p id="id00344">"Because it takes incalculable strength just to live in those deep
strata and withstand their pressure."</p>

<p id="id00345">"Oh really?"  Ned said, tipping me a wink.</p>

<p id="id00346">"Oh really, and I can prove it to you with a few simple figures."</p>

<p id="id00347">"Bosh!"  Ned replied.  "You can make figures do anything you want!"</p>

<p id="id00348">"In business, Ned, but not in mathematics.  Listen to me.
Let's accept that the pressure of one atmosphere is represented
by the pressure of a column of water thirty-two feet high.
In reality, such a column of water wouldn't be quite so high because
here we're dealing with salt water, which is denser than fresh water.
Well then, when you dive under the waves, Ned, for every thirty-two
feet of water above you, your body is tolerating the pressure
of one more atmosphere, in other words, one more kilogram per
each square centimeter on your body's surface.  So it follows
that at 320 feet down, this pressure is equal to ten atmospheres,
to 100 atmospheres at 3,200 feet, and to 1,000 atmospheres at
32,000 feet, that is, at about two and a half vertical leagues down.
Which is tantamount to saying that if you could reach such a depth
in the ocean, each square centimeter on your body's surface would
be experiencing 1,000 kilograms of pressure.  Now, my gallant Ned,
do you know how many square centimeters you have on your bodily surface?"</p>

<p id="id00349">"I haven't the foggiest notion, Professor Aronnax."</p>

<p id="id00350">"About 17,000."</p>

<p id="id00351">"As many as that?"</p>

<p id="id00352">"Yes, and since the atmosphere's pressure actually weighs slightly
more than one kilogram per square centimeter, your 17,000 square
centimeters are tolerating 17,568 kilograms at this very moment."</p>

<p id="id00353">"Without my noticing it?"</p>

<p id="id00354">"Without your noticing it.  And if you aren't crushed by so much pressure,
it's because the air penetrates the interior of your body with
equal pressure.  When the inside and outside pressures are in
perfect balance, they neutralize each other and allow you to tolerate
them without discomfort.  But in the water it's another story."</p>

<p id="id00355">"Yes, I see," Ned replied, growing more interested.<br/>

"Because the water surrounds me but doesn't penetrate me."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00356">"Precisely, Ned.  So at thirty-two feet beneath the surface of the sea,
you'll undergo a pressure of 17,568 kilograms; at 320 feet, or ten times
greater pressure, it's 175,680 kilograms; at 3,200 feet, or 100 times
greater pressure, it's 1,756,800 kilograms; finally, at 32,000 feet,
or 1,000 times greater pressure, it's 17,568,000 kilograms;
in other words, you'd be squashed as flat as if you'd just been
yanked from between the plates of a hydraulic press!"</p>

<p id="id00357">"Fire and brimstone!"  Ned put in.</p>

<p id="id00358">"All right then, my fine harpooner, if vertebrates several hundred
meters long and proportionate in bulk live at such depths,
their surface areas make up millions of square centimeters,
and the pressure they undergo must be assessed in billions of kilograms.
Calculate, then, how much resistance of bone structure and strength
of constitution they'd need in order to withstand such pressures!"</p>

<p id="id00359">"They'd need to be manufactured," Ned Land replied, "from sheet-iron
plates eight inches thick, like ironclad frigates."</p>

<p id="id00360">"Right, Ned, and then picture the damage such a mass could inflict
if it were launched with the speed of an express train against
a ship's hull."</p>

<p id="id00361">"Yes . . . indeed . . . maybe," the Canadian replied, staggered by
these figures but still not willing to give in.</p>

<p id="id00362">"Well, have I convinced you?"</p>

<p id="id00363">"You've convinced me of one thing, Mr. Naturalist.  That deep
in the sea, such animals would need to be just as strong as you say—
if they exist."</p>

<p id="id00364">"But if they don't exist, my stubborn harpooner, how do you explain
the accident that happened to the Scotia?"</p>

<p id="id00365">"It's maybe . . . ," Ned said, hesitating.</p>

<p id="id00366">"Go on!"</p>

<p id="id00367">"Because . . . it just couldn't be true!" the Canadian replied,
unconsciously echoing a famous catchphrase of the scientist Arago.</p>

<p id="id00368">But this reply proved nothing, other than how bullheaded the harpooner
could be.  That day I pressed him no further.  The Scotia's accident
was undeniable.  Its hole was real enough that it had to be plugged up,
and I don't think a hole's existence can be more emphatically proven.
Now then, this hole didn't make itself, and since it hadn't resulted
from underwater rocks or underwater machines, it must have been
caused by the perforating tool of some animal.</p>

<p id="id00369">Now, for all the reasons put forward to this point, I believed that
this animal was a member of the branch Vertebrata, class Mammalia,
group Pisciforma, and finally, order Cetacea.  As for the family
in which it would be placed (baleen whale, sperm whale, or dolphin),
the genus to which it belonged, and the species in which it would
find its proper home, these questions had to be left for later.
To answer them called for dissecting this unknown monster; to dissect
it called for catching it; to catch it called for harpooning it—
which was Ned Land's business; to harpoon it called for sighting it—
which was the crew's business; and to sight it called for encountering it—
which was a chancy business.</p>

<h1 id="id00370" style="margin-top: 7em">CHAPTER 5</h1>

<p id="id00371" style="margin-top: 3em">At Random!</p>

<p id="id00372" style="margin-top: 3em">FOR SOME WHILE the voyage of the Abraham Lincoln was marked by
no incident.  But one circumstance arose that displayed Ned Land's
marvelous skills and showed just how much confidence we could
place in him.</p>

<p id="id00373">Off the Falkland Islands on June 30, the frigate came in contact
with a fleet of American whalers, and we learned that they hadn't
seen the narwhale.  But one of them, the captain of the Monroe,
knew that Ned Land had shipped aboard the Abraham Lincoln
and asked his help in hunting a baleen whale that was in sight.
Anxious to see Ned Land at work, Commander Farragut authorized him
to make his way aboard the Monroe.  And the Canadian had such good luck
that with a right-and-left shot, he harpooned not one whale but two,
striking the first straight to the heart and catching the other
after a few minutes' chase!</p>

<p id="id00374">Assuredly, if the monster ever had to deal with Ned Land's harpoon,<br/>

I wouldn't bet on the monster.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00375">The frigate sailed along the east coast of South America with
prodigious speed.  By July 3 we were at the entrance to the Strait
of Magellan, abreast of Cabo de las Virgenes.  But Commander Farragut
was unwilling to attempt this tortuous passageway and maneuvered
instead to double Cape Horn.</p>

<p id="id00376">The crew sided with him unanimously.  Indeed, were we
likely to encounter the narwhale in such a cramped strait?
Many of our sailors swore that the monster couldn't negotiate this
passageway simply because "he's too big for it!"</p>

<p id="id00377">Near three o'clock in the afternoon on July 6, fifteen miles south
of shore, the Abraham Lincoln doubled that solitary islet at the tip
of the South American continent, that stray rock Dutch seamen had
named Cape Horn after their hometown of Hoorn.  Our course was set
for the northwest, and the next day our frigate's propeller finally
churned the waters of the Pacific.</p>

<p id="id00378">"Open your eyes!  Open your eyes!" repeated the sailors of
the Abraham Lincoln.</p>

<p id="id00379">And they opened amazingly wide.  Eyes and spyglasses (a bit dazzled,
it is true, by the vista of $2,000.00) didn't remain at rest for
an instant.  Day and night we observed the surface of the ocean,
and those with nyctalopic eyes, whose ability to see in the dark
increased their chances by fifty percent, had an excellent shot
at winning the prize.</p>

<p id="id00380">As for me, I was hardly drawn by the lure of money and yet was far from
the least attentive on board.  Snatching only a few minutes for meals
and a few hours for sleep, come rain or come shine, I no longer left
the ship's deck.  Sometimes bending over the forecastle railings,
sometimes leaning against the sternrail, I eagerly scoured that
cotton-colored wake that whitened the ocean as far as the eye could see!
And how many times I shared the excitement of general staff and crew
when some unpredictable whale lifted its blackish back above the waves.
In an instant the frigate's deck would become densely populated.
The cowls over the companionways would vomit a torrent of sailors
and officers.  With panting chests and anxious eyes, we each would
observe the cetacean's movements.  I stared; I stared until I nearly
went blind from a worn-out retina, while Conseil, as stoic as ever,
kept repeating to me in a calm tone:</p>

<p id="id00381">"If master's eyes would kindly stop bulging, master will see farther!"</p>

<p id="id00382">But what a waste of energy!  The Abraham Lincoln would change
course and race after the animal sighted, only to find an ordinary
baleen whale or a common sperm whale that soon disappeared amid
a chorus of curses!</p>

<p id="id00383">However, the weather held good.  Our voyage was proceeding under
the most favorable conditions.  By then it was the bad season
in these southernmost regions, because July in this zone corresponds
to our January in Europe; but the sea remained smooth and easily
visible over a vast perimeter.</p>

<p id="id00384">Ned Land still kept up the most tenacious skepticism; beyond his
spells on watch, he pretended that he never even looked at
the surface of the waves, at least while no whales were in sight.
And yet the marvelous power of his vision could have performed
yeoman service.  But this stubborn Canadian spent eight
hours out of every twelve reading or sleeping in his cabin.
A hundred times I chided him for his unconcern.</p>

<p id="id00385">"Bah!" he replied.  "Nothing's out there, Professor Aronnax,
and if there is some animal, what chance would we have of spotting it?
Can't you see we're just wandering around at random?  People say
they've sighted this slippery beast again in the Pacific high seas—
I'm truly willing to believe it, but two months have already gone
by since then, and judging by your narwhale's personality, it hates
growing moldy from hanging out too long in the same waterways!
It's blessed with a terrific gift for getting around.
Now, professor, you know even better than I that nature doesn't
violate good sense, and she wouldn't give some naturally slow animal
the ability to move swiftly if it hadn't a need to use that talent.
So if the beast does exist, it's already long gone!"</p>

<p id="id00386">I had no reply to this.  Obviously we were just groping blindly.
But how else could we go about it?  All the same, our chances were
automatically pretty limited.  Yet everyone still felt confident
of success, and not a sailor on board would have bet against
the narwhale appearing, and soon.</p>

<p id="id00387">On July 20 we cut the Tropic of Capricorn at longitude 105
degrees, and by the 27th of the same month, we had cleared
the equator on the 110th meridian.  These bearings determined,
the frigate took a more decisive westward heading and tackled
the seas of the central Pacific.  Commander Farragut felt,
and with good reason, that it was best to stay in deep waters and
keep his distance from continents or islands, whose neighborhoods
the animal always seemed to avoid—"No doubt," our bosun said,
"because there isn't enough water for him!"  So the frigate kept
well out when passing the Tuamotu, Marquesas, and Hawaiian Islands,
then cut the Tropic of Cancer at longitude 132 degrees and headed
for the seas of China.</p>

<p id="id00388">We were finally in the area of the monster's latest antics!
And in all honesty, shipboard conditions became life-threatening.
Hearts were pounding hideously, gearing up for futures full
of incurable aneurysms.  The entire crew suffered from a nervous
excitement that it's beyond me to describe.  Nobody ate, nobody slept.
Twenty times a day some error in perception, or the optical
illusions of some sailor perched in the crosstrees, would cause
intolerable anguish, and this emotion, repeated twenty times over,
kept us in a state of irritability so intense that a reaction was
bound to follow.</p>

<p id="id00389">And this reaction wasn't long in coming.  For three months,
during which each day seemed like a century, the Abraham Lincoln plowed
all the northerly seas of the Pacific, racing after whales sighted,
abruptly veering off course, swerving sharply from one tack to another,
stopping suddenly, putting on steam and reversing engines in quick
succession, at the risk of stripping its gears, and it didn't leave
a single point unexplored from the beaches of Japan to the coasts
of America.  And we found nothing!  Nothing except an immenseness
of deserted waves!  Nothing remotely resembling a gigantic narwhale,
or an underwater islet, or a derelict shipwreck, or a runaway reef,
or anything the least bit unearthly!</p>

<p id="id00390">So the reaction set in.  At first, discouragement took hold of
people's minds, opening the door to disbelief.  A new feeling appeared
on board, made up of three-tenths shame and seven-tenths fury.
The crew called themselves "out-and-out fools" for being
hoodwinked by a fairy tale, then grew steadily more furious!
The mountains of arguments amassed over a year collapsed all at once,
and each man now wanted only to catch up on his eating and sleeping,
to make up for the time he had so stupidly sacrificed.</p>

<p id="id00391">With typical human fickleness, they jumped from one extreme
to the other.  Inevitably, the most enthusiastic supporters
of the undertaking became its most energetic opponents.
This reaction mounted upward from the bowels of the ship, from the
quarters of the bunker hands to the messroom of the general staff;
and for certain, if it hadn't been for Commander Farragut's
characteristic stubbornness, the frigate would ultimately have put
back to that cape in the south.</p>

<p id="id00392">But this futile search couldn't drag on much longer.
The Abraham Lincoln had done everything it could to succeed and
had no reason to blame itself.  Never had the crew of an American
naval craft shown more patience and zeal; they weren't responsible
for this failure; there was nothing to do but go home.</p>

<p id="id00393">A request to this effect was presented to the commander.
The commander stood his ground.  His sailors couldn't hide
their discontent, and their work suffered because of it.
I'm unwilling to say that there was mutiny on board, but after
a reasonable period of intransigence, Commander Farragut,
like Christopher Columbus before him, asked for a grace period
of just three days more.  After this three-day delay, if the monster
hadn't appeared, our helmsman would give three turns of the wheel,
and the Abraham Lincoln would chart a course toward European seas.</p>

<p id="id00394">This promise was given on November 2.  It had the immediate effect
of reviving the crew's failing spirits.  The ocean was observed
with renewed care.  Each man wanted one last look with which to sum
up his experience.  Spyglasses functioned with feverish energy.
A supreme challenge had been issued to the giant narwhale, and the latter
had no acceptable excuse for ignoring this Summons to Appear!</p>

<p id="id00395">Two days passed.  The Abraham Lincoln stayed at half steam.
On the offchance that the animal might be found in these waterways,
a thousand methods were used to spark its interest or rouse it
from its apathy.  Enormous sides of bacon were trailed in our wake,
to the great satisfaction, I must say, of assorted sharks.
While the Abraham Lincoln heaved to, its longboats radiated
in every direction around it and didn't leave a single point
of the sea unexplored.  But the evening of November 4 arrived
with this underwater mystery still unsolved.</p>

<p id="id00396">At noon the next day, November 5, the agreed-upon delay expired.
After a position fix, true to his promise, Commander Farragut would
have to set his course for the southeast and leave the northerly
regions of the Pacific decisively behind.</p>

<p id="id00397">By then the frigate lay in latitude 31 degrees 15' north and longitude
136 degrees 42' east.  The shores of Japan were less than 200 miles
to our leeward.  Night was coming on.  Eight o'clock had just struck.
Huge clouds covered the moon's disk, then in its first quarter.
The sea undulated placidly beneath the frigate's stempost.</p>

<p id="id00398">Just then I was in the bow, leaning over the starboard rail.
Conseil, stationed beside me, stared straight ahead.
Roosting in the shrouds, the crew examined the horizon, which shrank
and darkened little by little.  Officers were probing the increasing
gloom with their night glasses.  Sometimes the murky ocean sparkled
beneath moonbeams that darted between the fringes of two clouds.
Then all traces of light vanished into the darkness.</p>

<p id="id00399">Observing Conseil, I discovered that, just barely, the gallant lad
had fallen under the general influence.  At least so I thought.
Perhaps his nerves were twitching with curiosity for the first
time in history.</p>

<p id="id00400">"Come on, Conseil!"  I told him.  "Here's your last chance to
pocket that $2,000.00!"</p>

<p id="id00401">"If master will permit my saying so," Conseil replied, "I never
expected to win that prize, and the Union government could have
promised $100,000.00 and been none the poorer."</p>

<p id="id00402">"You're right, Conseil, it turned out to be a foolish business
after all, and we jumped into it too hastily.  What a waste of time,
what a futile expense of emotion!  Six months ago we could have been
back in France—"</p>

<p id="id00403">"In master's little apartment," Conseil answered.  "In master's museum!
And by now I would have classified master's fossils.
And master's babirusa would be ensconced in its cage at the zoo
in the Botanical Gardens, and it would have attracted every curiosity
seeker in town!"</p>

<p id="id00404">"Quite so, Conseil, and what's more, I imagine that people will soon
be poking fun at us!"</p>

<p id="id00405">"To be sure," Conseil replied serenely, "I do think they'll have fun
at master's expense.  And must it be said . . . ?"</p>

<p id="id00406">"It must be said, Conseil."</p>

<p id="id00407">"Well then, it will serve master right!"</p>

<p id="id00408">"How true!"</p>

<p id="id00409">"When one has the honor of being an expert as master is, one mustn't
lay himself open to—"</p>

<p id="id00410">Conseil didn't have time to complete the compliment.<br/>

In the midst of the general silence, a voice became audible.<br/>

It was Ned Land's voice, and it shouted:<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00411">"Ahoy!  There's the thing in question, abreast of us to leeward!"</p>

</body>
