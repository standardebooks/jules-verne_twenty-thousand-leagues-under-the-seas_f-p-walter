  <body><h1 id="id01489" style="margin-top: 5em">CHAPTER 21</h1>

<p id="id01490" style="margin-top: 3em">Some Days Ashore</p>

<p id="id01491" style="margin-top: 3em">STEPPING ASHORE had an exhilarating effect on me.  Ned Land
tested the soil with his foot, as if he were laying claim to it.
Yet it had been only two months since we had become, as Captain Nemo
expressed it, "passengers on the Nautilus," in other words,
the literal prisoners of its commander.</p>

<p id="id01492">In a few minutes we were a gunshot away from the coast.  The soil was
almost entirely madreporic, but certain dry stream beds were strewn
with granite rubble, proving that this island was of primordial origin.
The entire horizon was hidden behind a curtain of wonderful forests.
Enormous trees, sometimes as high as 200 feet, were linked to each
other by garlands of tropical creepers, genuine natural hammocks
that swayed in a mild breeze.  There were mimosas, banyan trees,
beefwood, teakwood, hibiscus, screw pines, palm trees, all mingling
in wild profusion; and beneath the shade of their green canopies,
at the feet of their gigantic trunks, there grew orchids,
leguminous plants, and ferns.</p>

<p id="id01493">Meanwhile, ignoring all these fine specimens of Papuan flora,
the Canadian passed up the decorative in favor of the functional.
He spotted a coconut palm, beat down some of its fruit, broke them open,
and we drank their milk and ate their meat with a pleasure that was
a protest against our standard fare on the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id01494">"Excellent!"  Ned Land said.</p>

<p id="id01495" style="margin-top: 4em">"Exquisite!"  Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id01496">"And I don't think," the Canadian said, "that your Nemo would object
to us stashing a cargo of coconuts aboard his vessel?"</p>

<p id="id01497">"I imagine not," I replied, "but he won't want to sample them."</p>

<p id="id01498">"Too bad for him!"  Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id01499">"And plenty good for us!"  Ned Land shot back.  "There'll be
more left over!"</p>

<p id="id01500">"A word of caution, Mr. Land," I told the harpooner, who was about
to ravage another coconut palm.  "Coconuts are admirable things,
but before we stuff the skiff with them, it would be wise to find
out whether this island offers other substances just as useful.
Some fresh vegetables would be well received in the Nautilus's pantry."</p>

<p id="id01501">"Master is right," Conseil replied, "and I propose that we set aside
three places in our longboat:  one for fruit, another for vegetables,
and a third for venison, of which I still haven't glimpsed
the tiniest specimen."</p>

<p id="id01502">"Don't give up so easily, Conseil," the Canadian replied.</p>

<p id="id01503">"So let's continue our excursion," I went on, "but keep a sharp lookout.
This island seems uninhabited, but it still might harbor certain
individuals who aren't so finicky about the sort of game they eat!"</p>

<p id="id01504">"Hee hee!"  Ned put in, with a meaningful movement of his jaws.</p>

<p id="id01505">"Ned!  Oh horrors!"  Conseil exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01506">"Ye gods," the Canadian shot back, "I'm starting to appreciate
the charms of cannibalism!"</p>

<p id="id01507">"Ned, Ned!  Don't say that!"  Conseil answered.  "You a cannibal?<br/>

Why, I'll no longer be safe next to you, I who share your cabin!<br/>

Does this mean I'll wake up half devoured one fine day?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01508">"I'm awfully fond of you, Conseil my friend, but not enough to eat
you when there's better food around."</p>

<p id="id01509">"Then I daren't delay," Conseil replied.  "The hunt is on!
We absolutely must bag some game to placate this man-eater, or one
of these mornings master won't find enough pieces of his manservant
to serve him."</p>

<p id="id01510">While exchanging this chitchat, we entered beneath the dark canopies
of the forest, and for two hours we explored it in every direction.</p>

<p id="id01511">We couldn't have been luckier in our search for edible vegetation,
and some of the most useful produce in the tropical zones supplied
us with a valuable foodstuff missing on board.</p>

<p id="id01512">I mean the breadfruit tree, which is quite abundant on Gueboroa Island,
and there I chiefly noted the seedless variety that in Malaysia
is called "rima."</p>

<p id="id01513">This tree is distinguished from other trees by a straight trunk forty
feet high.  To the naturalist's eye, its gracefully rounded crown,
formed of big multilobed leaves, was enough to denote the artocarpus
that has been so successfully transplanted to the Mascarene Islands east of</p>

<p id="id01514">Madagascar.  From its mass of greenery, huge globular fruit stood out,
a decimeter wide and furnished on the outside with creases that
assumed a hexangular pattern.  It's a handy plant that nature gives
to regions lacking in wheat; without needing to be cultivated,
it bears fruit eight months out of the year.</p>

<p id="id01515">Ned Land was on familiar terms with this fruit.  He had already eaten
it on his many voyages and knew how to cook its edible substance.
So the very sight of it aroused his appetite, and he couldn't
control himself.</p>

<p id="id01516">"Sir," he told me, "I'll die if I don't sample a little breadfruit pasta!"</p>

<p id="id01517">"Sample some, Ned my friend, sample all you like.  We're here
to conduct experiments, let's conduct them."</p>

<p id="id01518">"It won't take a minute," the Canadian replied.</p>

<p id="id01519">Equipped with a magnifying glass, he lit a fire of deadwood
that was soon crackling merrily.  Meanwhile Conseil and I selected
the finest artocarpus fruit.  Some still weren't ripe enough,
and their thick skins covered white, slightly fibrous pulps.
But a great many others were yellowish and gelatinous, just begging
to be picked.</p>

<p id="id01520">This fruit contained no pits.  Conseil brought a dozen of them
to Ned Land, who cut them into thick slices and placed them over
a fire of live coals, all the while repeating:</p>

<p id="id01521">"You'll see, sir, how tasty this bread is!"</p>

<p id="id01522">"Especially since we've gone without baked goods for so long,"<br/>

Conseil said.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01523">"It's more than just bread," the Canadian added.  "It's a dainty pastry.<br/>

You've never eaten any, sir?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01524">"No, Ned."</p>

<p id="id01525">"All right, get ready for something downright delectable!<br/>

If you don't come back for seconds, I'm no longer the King of Harpooners!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01526">After a few minutes, the parts of the fruit exposed to the fire were
completely toasted.  On the inside there appeared some white pasta,
a sort of soft bread center whose flavor reminded me of artichoke.</p>

<p id="id01527">This bread was excellent, I must admit, and I ate it with great pleasure.</p>

<p id="id01528">"Unfortunately," I said, "this pasta won't stay fresh, so it seems
pointless to make a supply for on board."</p>

<p id="id01529">"By thunder, sir!"  Ned Land exclaimed.  "There you go,
talking like a naturalist, but meantime I'll be acting like a baker!
Conseil, harvest some of this fruit to take with us when we go back."</p>

<p id="id01530">"And how will you prepare it?"  I asked the Canadian.</p>

<p id="id01531">"I'll make a fermented batter from its pulp that'll keep
indefinitely without spoiling.  When I want some, I'll just cook
it in the galley on board—it'll have a slightly tart flavor,
but you'll find it excellent."</p>

<p id="id01532" style="margin-top: 4em">"So, Mr. Ned, I see that this bread is all we need—"</p>

<p id="id01533">"Not quite, professor," the Canadian replied.  "We need some fruit
to go with it, or at least some vegetables."</p>

<p id="id01534">"Then let's look for fruit and vegetables."</p>

<p id="id01535">When our breadfruit harvesting was done, we took to the trail
to complete this "dry-land dinner."</p>

<p id="id01536">We didn't search in vain, and near noontime we had an ample supply
of bananas.  This delicious produce from the Torrid Zones ripens
all year round, and Malaysians, who give them the name "pisang,"
eat them without bothering to cook them.  In addition to bananas,
we gathered some enormous jackfruit with a very tangy flavor,
some tasty mangoes, and some pineapples of unbelievable size.
But this foraging took up a good deal of our time, which, even so,
we had no cause to regret.</p>

<p id="id01537">Conseil kept Ned under observation.  The harpooner walked in the lead,
and during his stroll through this forest, he gathered with sure hands
some excellent fruit that should have completed his provisions.</p>

<p id="id01538">"So," Conseil asked, "you have everything you need, Ned my friend?"</p>

<p id="id01539">"Humph!" the Canadian put in.</p>

<p id="id01540">"What!  You're complaining?"</p>

<p id="id01541">"All this vegetation doesn't make a meal," Ned replied.<br/>

"Just side dishes, dessert.  But where's the soup course?<br/>

Where's the roast?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01542">"Right," I said.  "Ned promised us cutlets, which seems highly
questionable to me."</p>

<p id="id01543">"Sir," the Canadian replied, "our hunting not only isn't over,
it hasn't even started.  Patience!  We're sure to end up bumping
into some animal with either feathers or fur, if not in this locality,
then in another."</p>

<p id="id01544">"And if not today, then tomorrow, because we mustn't wander too far off,"<br/>

Conseil added.  "That's why I propose that we return to the skiff."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01545">"What!  Already!"  Ned exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01546">"We ought to be back before nightfall," I said.</p>

<p id="id01547">"But what hour is it, then?" the Canadian asked.</p>

<p id="id01548">"Two o'clock at least," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id01549">"How time flies on solid ground!" exclaimed Mr. Ned Land with a
sigh of regret.</p>

<p id="id01550">"Off we go!"  Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id01551">So we returned through the forest, and we completed our harvest
by making a clean sweep of some palm cabbages that had to be picked
from the crowns of their trees, some small beans that I recognized
as the "abrou" of the Malaysians, and some high-quality yams.</p>

<p id="id01552">We were overloaded when we arrived at the skiff.  However, Ned Land
still found these provisions inadequate.  But fortune smiled on him.
Just as we were boarding, he spotted several trees twenty-five
to thirty feet high, belonging to the palm species.
As valuable as the artocarpus, these trees are justly ranked among
the most useful produce in Malaysia.</p>

<p id="id01553">They were sago palms, vegetation that grows without being cultivated;
like mulberry trees, they reproduce by means of shoots and seeds.</p>

<p id="id01554">Ned Land knew how to handle these trees.  Taking his ax and wielding
it with great vigor, he soon stretched out on the ground two or
three sago palms, whose maturity was revealed by the white dust
sprinkled over their palm fronds.</p>

<p id="id01555">I watched him more as a naturalist than as a man in hunger.
He began by removing from each trunk an inch-thick strip of bark that
covered a network of long, hopelessly tangled fibers that were puttied
with a sort of gummy flour.  This flour was the starch-like sago,
an edible substance chiefly consumed by the Melanesian peoples.</p>

<p id="id01556">For the time being, Ned Land was content to chop these trunks into pieces,
as if he were making firewood; later he would extract the flour
by sifting it through cloth to separate it from its fibrous ligaments,
let it dry out in the sun, and leave it to harden inside molds.</p>

<p id="id01557">Finally, at five o'clock in the afternoon, laden with all our treasures,
we left the island beach and half an hour later pulled alongside
the Nautilus.  Nobody appeared on our arrival.  The enormous
sheet-iron cylinder seemed deserted.  Our provisions loaded on board,
I went below to my stateroom.  There I found my supper ready.
I ate and then fell asleep.</p>

<p id="id01558">The next day, January 6:  nothing new on board.  Not a sound inside,
not a sign of life.  The skiff stayed alongside in the same place
we had left it.  We decided to return to Gueboroa Island.  Ned Land
hoped for better luck in his hunting than on the day before,
and he wanted to visit a different part of the forest.</p>

<p id="id01559">By sunrise we were off.  Carried by an inbound current, the longboat
reached the island in a matter of moments.</p>

<p id="id01560">We disembarked, and thinking it best to abide by the Canadian's instincts,
we followed Ned Land, whose long legs threatened to outpace us.</p>

<p id="id01561">Ned Land went westward up the coast; then, fording some stream beds,
he reached open plains that were bordered by wonderful forests.
Some kingfishers lurked along the watercourses, but they didn't
let us approach.  Their cautious behavior proved to me that these
winged creatures knew where they stood on bipeds of our species,
and I concluded that if this island wasn't inhabited, at least
human beings paid it frequent visits.</p>

<p id="id01562">After crossing a pretty lush prairie, we arrived on the outskirts
of a small wood, enlivened by the singing and soaring of a large
number of birds.</p>

<p id="id01563">"Still, they're merely birds," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id01564">"But some are edible," the harpooner replied.</p>

<p id="id01565">"Wrong, Ned my friend," Conseil answered, "because I see only
ordinary parrots here."</p>

<p id="id01566" style="margin-top: 4em">"Conseil my friend," Ned replied in all seriousness, "parrots are
like pheasant to people with nothing else on their plates."</p>

<p id="id01567">"And I might add," I said, "that when these birds are properly cooked,
they're at least worth a stab of the fork."</p>

<p id="id01568">Indeed, under the dense foliage of this wood, a whole host of parrots
fluttered from branch to branch, needing only the proper upbringing
to speak human dialects.  At present they were cackling in chorus
with parakeets of every color, with solemn cockatoos that seemed to be
pondering some philosophical problem, while bright red lories passed
by like pieces of bunting borne on the breeze, in the midst of kalao
parrots raucously on the wing, Papuan lories painted the subtlest
shades of azure, and a whole variety of delightful winged creatures,
none terribly edible.</p>

<p id="id01569">However, one bird unique to these shores, which never passes
beyond the boundaries of the Aru and Papuan Islands, was missing
from this collection.  But I was given a chance to marvel at
it soon enough.</p>

<p id="id01570">After crossing through a moderately dense thicket, we again found
some plains obstructed by bushes.  There I saw some magnificent birds
soaring aloft, the arrangement of their long feathers causing them to head
into the wind.  Their undulating flight, the grace of their aerial curves,
and the play of their colors allured and delighted the eye.
I had no trouble identifying them.</p>

<p id="id01571">"Birds of paradise!"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01572">"Order Passeriforma, division Clystomora," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id01573">"Partridge family?"  Ned Land asked.</p>

<p id="id01574">"I doubt it, Mr. Land.  Nevertheless, I'm counting on your dexterity
to catch me one of these delightful representatives of tropical nature!"</p>

<p id="id01575">"I'll give it a try, professor, though I'm handier with a harpoon
than a rifle."</p>

<p id="id01576">Malaysians, who do a booming business in these birds with the Chinese,
have various methods for catching them that we couldn't use.
Sometimes they set snares on the tops of the tall trees that
the bird of paradise prefers to inhabit.  At other times they
capture it with a tenacious glue that paralyzes its movements.
They will even go so far as to poison the springs where these fowl
habitually drink.  But in our case, all we could do was fire
at them on the wing, which left us little chance of getting one.
And in truth, we used up a good part of our ammunition in vain.</p>

<p id="id01577">Near eleven o'clock in the morning, we cleared the lower
slopes of the mountains that form the island's center,
and we still hadn't bagged a thing.  Hunger spurred us on.
The hunters had counted on consuming the proceeds of their hunting,
and they had miscalculated.  Luckily, and much to his surprise,
Conseil pulled off a right-and-left shot and insured our breakfast.
He brought down a white pigeon and a ringdove, which were briskly plucked,
hung from a spit, and roasted over a blazing fire of deadwood.
While these fascinating animals were cooking, Ned prepared some bread
from the artocarpus.  Then the pigeon and ringdove were devoured
to the bones and declared excellent.  Nutmeg, on which these birds
habitually gorge themselves, sweetens their flesh and makes
it delicious eating.</p>

<p id="id01578">"They taste like chicken stuffed with truffles," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id01579">"All right, Ned," I asked the Canadian, "now what do you need?"</p>

<p id="id01580">"Game with four paws, Professor Aronnax," Ned Land replied.
"All these pigeons are only appetizers, snacks.  So till I've bagged
an animal with cutlets, I won't be happy!"</p>

<p id="id01581">"Nor I, Ned, until I've caught a bird of paradise."</p>

<p id="id01582">"Then let's keep hunting," Conseil replied, "but while heading back
to the sea.  We've arrived at the foothills of these mountains,
and I think we'll do better if we return to the forest regions."</p>

<p id="id01583">It was good advice and we took it.  After an hour's walk we reached
a genuine sago palm forest.  A few harmless snakes fled underfoot.
Birds of paradise stole off at our approach, and I was in real
despair of catching one when Conseil, walking in the lead,
stooped suddenly, gave a triumphant shout, and came back to me,
carrying a magnificent bird of paradise.</p>

<p id="id01584">"Oh bravo, Conseil!"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01585">"Master is too kind," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id01586">"Not at all, my boy.  That was a stroke of genius, catching one
of these live birds with your bare hands!"</p>

<p id="id01587">"If master will examine it closely, he'll see that I deserve
no great praise."</p>

<p id="id01588">"And why not, Conseil?"</p>

<p id="id01589">"Because this bird is as drunk as a lord."</p>

<p id="id01590">"Drunk?"</p>

<p id="id01591">"Yes, master, drunk from the nutmegs it was devouring under that nutmeg
tree where I caught it.  See, Ned my friend, see the monstrous
results of intemperance!"</p>

<p id="id01592">"Damnation!" the Canadian shot back.  "Considering the amount of gin<br/>

I've had these past two months, you've got nothing to complain about!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01593">Meanwhile I was examining this unusual bird.  Conseil was not mistaken.<br/>

Tipsy from that potent juice, our bird of paradise had been reduced<br/>

to helplessness.  It was unable to fly.  It was barely able to walk.<br/>

But this didn't alarm me, and I just let it sleep off its nutmeg.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01594">This bird belonged to the finest of the eight species credited
to Papua and its neighboring islands.  It was a "great emerald,"
one of the rarest birds of paradise.  It measured three decimeters long.
Its head was comparatively small, and its eyes, placed near the opening of
its beak, were also small.  But it offered a wonderful mixture of hues:
a yellow beak, brown feet and claws, hazel wings with purple tips,
pale yellow head and scruff of the neck, emerald throat, the belly
and chest maroon to brown.  Two strands, made of a horn substance
covered with down, rose over its tail, which was lengthened by long,
very light feathers of wonderful fineness, and they completed
the costume of this marvelous bird that the islanders have poetically
named "the sun bird."</p>

<p id="id01595" style="margin-top: 4em">How I wished I could take this superb bird of paradise back to Paris,
to make a gift of it to the zoo at the Botanical Gardens,
which doesn't own a single live specimen.</p>

<p id="id01596">"So it must be a rarity or something?" the Canadian asked,
in the tone of a hunter who, from the viewpoint of his art,
gives the game a pretty low rating.</p>

<p id="id01597">"A great rarity, my gallant comrade, and above all very hard to
capture alive.  And even after they're dead, there's still a major
market for these birds.  So the natives have figured out how to create
fake ones, like people create fake pearls or diamonds."</p>

<p id="id01598">"What!"  Conseil exclaimed.  "They make counterfeit birds of paradise?"</p>

<p id="id01599">"Yes, Conseil."</p>

<p id="id01600">"And is master familiar with how the islanders go about it?"</p>

<p id="id01601">"Perfectly familiar.  During the easterly monsoon season,
birds of paradise lose the magnificent feathers around their tails
that naturalists call 'below-the-wing' feathers.  These feathers
are gathered by the fowl forgers and skillfully fitted onto some poor
previously mutilated parakeet.  Then they paint over the suture,
varnish the bird, and ship the fruits of their unique labors
to museums and collectors in Europe."</p>

<p id="id01602">"Good enough!"  Ned Land put in.  "If it isn't the right bird,
it's still the right feathers, and so long as the merchandise isn't
meant to be eaten, I see no great harm!"</p>

<p id="id01603">But if my desires were fulfilled by the capture of this bird of paradise,
those of our Canadian huntsman remained unsatisfied.  Luckily, near two
o'clock Ned Land brought down a magnificent wild pig of the type
the natives call "bari-outang." This animal came in the nick of time
for us to bag some real quadruped meat, and it was warmly welcomed.
Ned Land proved himself quite gloriously with his gunshot.
Hit by an electric bullet, the pig dropped dead on the spot.</p>

<p id="id01604">The Canadian properly skinned and cleaned it, after removing half
a dozen cutlets destined to serve as the grilled meat course of our
evening meal.  Then the hunt was on again, and once more would
be marked by the exploits of Ned and Conseil.</p>

<p id="id01605">In essence, beating the bushes, the two friends flushed a herd
of kangaroos that fled by bounding away on their elastic paws.
But these animals didn't flee so swiftly that our electric capsules
couldn't catch up with them.</p>

<p id="id01606">"Oh, professor!" shouted Ned Land, whose hunting fever had gone
to his brain.  "What excellent game, especially in a stew!
What a supply for the Nautilus!  Two, three, five down!
And just think how we'll devour all this meat ourselves,
while those numbskulls on board won't get a shred!"</p>

<p id="id01607">In his uncontrollable glee, I think the Canadian might have
slaughtered the whole horde, if he hadn't been so busy talking!
But he was content with a dozen of these fascinating marsupials,
which make up the first order of aplacental mammals, as Conseil
just had to tell us.</p>

<p id="id01608">These animals were small in stature.  They were a species of those
"rabbit kangaroos" that usually dwell in the hollows of trees
and are tremendously fast; but although of moderate dimensions,
they at least furnish a meat that's highly prized.</p>

<p id="id01609">We were thoroughly satisfied with the results of our hunting.<br/>

A gleeful Ned proposed that we return the next day to this magic island,<br/>

which he planned to depopulate of its every edible quadruped.<br/>

But he was reckoning without events.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01610">By six o'clock in the evening, we were back on the beach.
The skiff was aground in its usual place.  The Nautilus, looking like
a long reef, emerged from the waves two miles offshore.</p>

<p id="id01611">Without further ado, Ned Land got down to the important business
of dinner.  He came wonderfully to terms with its entire cooking.
Grilling over the coals, those cutlets from the "bari-outang" soon
gave off a succulent aroma that perfumed the air.</p>

<p id="id01612">But I catch myself following in the Canadian's footsteps.<br/>

Look at me—in ecstasy over freshly grilled pork!<br/>

Please grant me a pardon as I've already granted one to Mr. Land,<br/>

and on the same grounds!<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01613">In short, dinner was excellent.  Two ringdoves rounded out this
extraordinary menu.  Sago pasta, bread from the artocarpus, mangoes,
half a dozen pineapples, and the fermented liquor from certain
coconuts heightened our glee.  I suspect that my two fine companions
weren't quite as clearheaded as one could wish.</p>

<p id="id01614">"What if we don't return to the Nautilus this evening?"  Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id01615">"What if we never return to it?"  Ned Land added.</p>

<p id="id01616">Just then a stone whizzed toward us, landed at our feet, and cut
short the harpooner's proposition.</p>

<h1 id="id01617" style="margin-top: 9em">CHAPTER 22</h1>

<p id="id01618" style="margin-top: 3em">The Lightning Bolts of Captain Nemo</p>

<p id="id01619" style="margin-top: 3em">WITHOUT STANDING UP, we stared in the direction of the forest, my hand
stopping halfway to my mouth, Ned Land's completing its assignment.</p>

<p id="id01620">"Stones don't fall from the sky," Conseil said, "or else they
deserve to be called meteorites."</p>

<p id="id01621">A second well-polished stone removed a tasty ringdove leg from<br/>

Conseil's hand, giving still greater relevance to his observation.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01622">We all three stood up, rifles to our shoulders, ready to
answer any attack.</p>

<p id="id01623">"Apes maybe?"  Ned Land exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01624">"Nearly," Conseil replied.  "Savages."</p>

<p id="id01625">"Head for the skiff!"  I said, moving toward the sea.</p>

<p id="id01626">Indeed, it was essential to beat a retreat because some twenty natives,
armed with bows and slings, appeared barely a hundred paces off,
on the outskirts of a thicket that masked the horizon to our right.</p>

<p id="id01627">The skiff was aground ten fathoms away from us.</p>

<p id="id01628">The savages approached without running, but they favored us with a
show of the greatest hostility.  It was raining stones and arrows.</p>

<p id="id01629">Ned Land was unwilling to leave his provisions behind, and despite
the impending danger, he clutched his pig on one side, his kangaroos
on the other, and scampered off with respectable speed.</p>

<p id="id01630">In two minutes we were on the strand.  Loading provisions and weapons
into the skiff, pushing it to sea, and positioning its two oars
were the work of an instant.  We hadn't gone two cable lengths
when a hundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water
up to their waists.  I looked to see if their appearance might
draw some of the Nautilus's men onto the platform.  But no.
Lying well out, that enormous machine still seemed completely deserted.</p>

<p id="id01631">Twenty minutes later we boarded ship.  The hatches were open.<br/>

After mooring the skiff, we reentered the Nautilus's interior.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01632">I went below to the lounge, from which some chords were wafting.<br/>

Captain Nemo was there, leaning over the organ, deep in a musical trance.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01633">"Captain!"  I said to him.</p>

<p id="id01634">He didn't hear me.</p>

<p id="id01635">"Captain!"  I went on, touching him with my hand.</p>

<p id="id01636">He trembled, and turning around:</p>

<p id="id01637">"Ah, it's you, professor!" he said to me.  "Well, did you have
a happy hunt?  Was your herb gathering a success?"</p>

<p id="id01638">"Yes, captain," I replied, "but unfortunately we've brought back
a horde of bipeds whose proximity worries me."</p>

<p id="id01639">"What sort of bipeds?"</p>

<p id="id01640">"Savages."</p>

<p id="id01641">"Savages!"  Captain Nemo replied in an ironic tone.  "You set
foot on one of the shores of this globe, professor, and you're
surprised to find savages there?  Where aren't there savages?
And besides, are they any worse than men elsewhere, these people
you call savages?"</p>

<p id="id01642">"But captain—"</p>

<p id="id01643">"Speaking for myself, sir, I've encountered them everywhere."</p>

<p id="id01644">"Well then," I replied, "if you don't want to welcome them aboard
the Nautilus, you'd better take some precautions!"</p>

<p id="id01645">"Easy, professor, no cause for alarm."</p>

<p id="id01646">"But there are a large number of these natives."</p>

<p id="id01647" style="margin-top: 4em">"What's your count?"</p>

<p id="id01648">"At least a hundred."</p>

<p id="id01649">"Professor Aronnax," replied Captain Nemo, whose fingers took
their places again on the organ keys, "if every islander in Papua
were to gather on that beach, the Nautilus would still have nothing
to fear from their attacks!"</p>

<p id="id01650">The captain's fingers then ran over the instrument's keyboard,
and I noticed that he touched only its black keys, which gave
his melodies a basically Scottish color.  Soon he had forgotten my
presence and was lost in a reverie that I no longer tried to dispel.</p>

<p id="id01651">I climbed onto the platform.  Night had already fallen, because in
this low latitude the sun sets quickly, without any twilight.
I could see Gueboroa Island only dimly.  But numerous fires had been
kindled on the beach, attesting that the natives had no thoughts
of leaving it.</p>

<p id="id01652">For several hours I was left to myself, sometimes musing on the islanders—
but no longer fearing them because the captain's unflappable confidence
had won me over—and sometimes forgetting them to marvel at the splendors
of this tropical night.  My memories took wing toward France, in the wake
of those zodiacal stars due to twinkle over it in a few hours.
The moon shone in the midst of the constellations at their zenith.
I then remembered that this loyal, good-natured satellite
would return to this same place the day after tomorrow,
to raise the tide and tear the Nautilus from its coral bed.
Near midnight, seeing that all was quiet over the darkened waves
as well as under the waterside trees, I repaired to my cabin and fell
into a peaceful sleep.</p>

<p id="id01653">The night passed without mishap.  No doubt the Papuans had been
frightened off by the mere sight of this monster aground in
the bay, because our hatches stayed open, offering easy access
to the Nautilus's interior.</p>

<p id="id01654">At six o'clock in the morning, January 8, I climbed onto the platform.
The morning shadows were lifting.  The island was soon on view
through the dissolving mists, first its beaches, then its summits.</p>

<p id="id01655">The islanders were still there, in greater numbers than on the day before,
perhaps 500 or 600 of them.  Taking advantage of the low tide,
some of them had moved forward over the heads of coral to within
two cable lengths of the Nautilus.  I could easily distinguish them.
They obviously were true Papuans, men of fine stock, athletic in build,
forehead high and broad, nose large but not flat, teeth white.
Their woolly, red-tinted hair was in sharp contrast to their bodies, which
were black and glistening like those of Nubians.  Beneath their pierced,
distended earlobes there dangled strings of beads made from bone.
Generally these savages were naked.  I noted some women among them,
dressed from hip to knee in grass skirts held up by belts made
of vegetation.  Some of the chieftains adorned their necks with
crescents and with necklaces made from beads of red and white glass.
Armed with bows, arrows, and shields, nearly all of them carried
from their shoulders a sort of net, which held those polished stones
their slings hurl with such dexterity.</p>

<p id="id01656" style="margin-top: 4em">One of these chieftains came fairly close to the Nautilus,
examining it with care.  He must have been a "mado" of high rank,
because he paraded in a mat of banana leaves that had ragged edges
and was accented with bright colors.</p>

<p id="id01657">I could easily have picked off this islander, he stood at such close
range; but I thought it best to wait for an actual show of hostility.
Between Europeans and savages, it's acceptable for Europeans to shoot
back but not to attack first.</p>

<p id="id01658">During this whole time of low tide, the islanders lurked near
the Nautilus, but they weren't boisterous.  I often heard them repeat
the word "assai," and from their gestures I understood they were
inviting me to go ashore, an invitation I felt obliged to decline.</p>

<p id="id01659">So the skiff didn't leave shipside that day, much to the
displeasure of Mr. Land who couldn't complete his provisions.
The adroit Canadian spent his time preparing the meat and flour
products he had brought from Gueboroa Island.  As for the savages,
they went back to shore near eleven o'clock in the morning, when the heads
of coral began to disappear under the waves of the rising tide.
But I saw their numbers swell considerably on the beach.
It was likely that they had come from neighboring islands
or from the mainland of Papua proper.  However, I didn't see one
local dugout canoe.</p>

<p id="id01660">Having nothing better to do, I decided to dredge these beautiful,
clear waters, which exhibited a profusion of shells, zoophytes,
and open-sea plants.  Besides, it was the last day the Nautilus
would spend in these waterways, if, tomorrow, it still floated off
to the open sea as Captain Nemo had promised.</p>

<p id="id01661">So I summoned Conseil, who brought me a small, light dragnet similar
to those used in oyster fishing.</p>

<p id="id01662">"What about these savages?"  Conseil asked me.  "With all due
respect to master, they don't strike me as very wicked!"</p>

<p id="id01663">"They're cannibals even so, my boy."</p>

<p id="id01664">"A person can be both a cannibal and a decent man," Conseil replied,
"just as a person can be both gluttonous and honorable.
The one doesn't exclude the other."</p>

<p id="id01665">"Fine, Conseil!  And I agree that there are honorable cannibals who
decently devour their prisoners.  However, I'm opposed to being devoured,
even in all decency, so I'll keep on my guard, especially since
the Nautilus's commander seems to be taking no precautions.
And now let's get to work!"</p>

<p id="id01666">For two hours our fishing proceeded energetically but without
bringing up any rarities.  Our dragnet was filled with Midas abalone,
harp shells, obelisk snails, and especially the finest hammer shells
I had seen to that day.  We also gathered in a few sea cucumbers,
some pearl oysters, and a dozen small turtles that we saved for
the ship's pantry.</p>

<p id="id01667">But just when I least expected it, I laid my hands on a wonder, a natural
deformity I'd have to call it, something very seldom encountered.
Conseil had just made a cast of the dragnet, and his gear had
come back up loaded with a variety of fairly ordinary seashells,
when suddenly he saw me plunge my arms swiftly into the net, pull out
a shelled animal, and give a conchological yell, in other words,
the most piercing yell a human throat can produce.</p>

<p id="id01668">"Eh?  What happened to master?"  Conseil asked, very startled.<br/>

"Did master get bitten?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01669">"No, my boy, but I'd gladly have sacrificed a finger for such a find!"</p>

<p id="id01670">"What find?"</p>

<p id="id01671">"This shell," I said, displaying the subject of my triumph.</p>

<p id="id01672">"But that's simply an olive shell of the 'tent olive' species,
genus Oliva, order Pectinibranchia, class Gastropoda, branch Mollusca—"</p>

<p id="id01673">"Yes, yes, Conseil!  But instead of coiling from right to left,
this olive shell rolls from left to right!"</p>

<p id="id01674">"It can't be!"  Conseil exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01675">"Yes, my boy, it's a left-handed shell!"</p>

<p id="id01676">"A left-handed shell!"  Conseil repeated, his heart pounding.</p>

<p id="id01677">"Look at its spiral!"</p>

<p id="id01678">"Oh, master can trust me on this," Conseil said, taking the valuable
shell in trembling hands, "but never have I felt such excitement!"</p>

<p id="id01679">And there was good reason to be excited!  In fact, as naturalists
have ventured to observe, "dextrality" is a well-known law of nature.
In their rotational and orbital movements, stars and their satellites go
from right to left.  Man uses his right hand more often than his left,
and consequently his various instruments and equipment (staircases, locks,
watch springs, etc.) are designed to be used in a right-to-left manner.
Now then, nature has generally obeyed this law in coiling her shells.
They're right-handed with only rare exceptions, and when by chance
a shell's spiral is left-handed, collectors will pay its weight
in gold for it.</p>

<p id="id01680">So Conseil and I were deep in the contemplation of our treasure,
and I was solemnly promising myself to enrich the Paris Museum
with it, when an ill-timed stone, hurled by one of the islanders,
whizzed over and shattered the valuable object in Conseil's hands.</p>

<p id="id01681">I gave a yell of despair!  Conseil pounced on his rifle and aimed
at a savage swinging a sling just ten meters away from him.
I tried to stop him, but his shot went off and shattered a bracelet
of amulets dangling from the islander's arm.</p>

<p id="id01682">"Conseil!"  I shouted.  "Conseil!"</p>

<p id="id01683">"Eh?  What?  Didn't master see that this man-eater initiated the attack?"</p>

<p id="id01684">"A shell isn't worth a human life!"  I told him.</p>

<p id="id01685">"Oh, the rascal!"  Conseil exclaimed.  "I'd rather he cracked
my shoulder!"</p>

<p id="id01686">Conseil was in dead earnest, but I didn't subscribe to his views.
However, the situation had changed in only a short time and we
hadn't noticed.  Now some twenty dugout canoes were surrounding
the Nautilus.  Hollowed from tree trunks, these dugouts were long,
narrow, and well designed for speed, keeping their balance by means
of two bamboo poles that floated on the surface of the water.
They were maneuvered by skillful, half-naked paddlers, and I viewed
their advance with definite alarm.</p>

<p id="id01687">It was obvious these Papuans had already entered into relations with
Europeans and knew their ships.  But this long, iron cylinder lying
in the bay, with no masts or funnels—what were they to make of it?
Nothing good, because at first they kept it at a respectful distance.
However, seeing that it stayed motionless, they regained confidence
little by little and tried to become more familiar with it.
Now then, it was precisely this familiarity that we needed to prevent.
Since our weapons made no sound when they went off, they would
have only a moderate effect on these islanders, who reputedly
respect nothing but noisy mechanisms.  Without thunderclaps,
lightning bolts would be much less frightening, although the danger
lies in the flash, not the noise.</p>

<p id="id01688">Just then the dugout canoes drew nearer to the Nautilus, and a cloud
of arrows burst over us.</p>

<p id="id01689">"Fire and brimstone, it's hailing!"  Conseil said.<br/>

"And poisoned hail perhaps!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01690">"We've got to alert Captain Nemo," I said, reentering the hatch.</p>

<p id="id01691">I went below to the lounge.  I found no one there.  I ventured
a knock at the door opening into the captain's stateroom.</p>

<p id="id01692">The word "Enter!" answered me.  I did so and found Captain Nemo
busy with calculations in which there was no shortage of X and
other algebraic signs.</p>

<p id="id01693">"Am I disturbing you?"  I said out of politeness.</p>

<p id="id01694">"Correct, Professor Aronnax," the captain answered me.<br/>

"But I imagine you have pressing reasons for looking me up?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01695">"Very pressing.  Native dugout canoes are surrounding us, and in a few
minutes we're sure to be assaulted by several hundred savages."</p>

<p id="id01696">"Ah!"  Captain Nemo put in serenely.  "They've come in their dugouts?"</p>

<p id="id01697">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p id="id01698">"Well, sir, closing the hatches should do the trick."</p>

<p id="id01699">"Precisely, and that's what I came to tell you—"</p>

<p id="id01700">"Nothing easier," Captain Nemo said.</p>

<p id="id01701">And he pressed an electric button, transmitting an order to
the crew's quarters.</p>

<p id="id01702">"There, sir, all under control!" he told me after a few moments.
"The skiff is in place and the hatches are closed.  I don't imagine
you're worried that these gentlemen will stave in walls that shells
from your frigate couldn't breach?"</p>

<p id="id01703">"No, captain, but one danger still remains."</p>

<p id="id01704">"What's that, sir?"</p>

<p id="id01705" style="margin-top: 4em">"Tomorrow at about this time, we'll need to reopen the hatches
to renew the Nautilus's air."</p>

<p id="id01706">"No argument, sir, since our craft breathes in the manner
favored by cetaceans."</p>

<p id="id01707">"But if these Papuans are occupying the platform at that moment,<br/>

I don't see how you can prevent them from entering."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01708">"Then, sir, you assume they'll board the ship?"</p>

<p id="id01709">"I'm certain of it."</p>

<p id="id01710">"Well, sir, let them come aboard.  I see no reason to prevent them.
Deep down they're just poor devils, these Papuans, and I don't
want my visit to Gueboroa Island to cost the life of a single one
of these unfortunate people!"</p>

<p id="id01711">On this note I was about to withdraw; but Captain Nemo detained
me and invited me to take a seat next to him.  He questioned me
with interest on our excursions ashore and on our hunting, but seemed
not to understand the Canadian's passionate craving for red meat.
Then our conversation skimmed various subjects, and without being
more forthcoming, Captain Nemo proved more affable.</p>

<p id="id01712">Among other things, we came to talk of the Nautilus's circumstances,
aground in the same strait where Captain Dumont d'Urville had
nearly miscarried.  Then, pertinent to this:</p>

<p id="id01713">"He was one of your great seamen," the captain told me,
"one of your shrewdest navigators, that d'Urville! He was
the Frenchman's Captain Cook.  A man wise but unlucky!
Braving the ice banks of the South Pole, the coral of Oceania,
the cannibals of the Pacific, only to perish wretchedly in a train wreck!
If that energetic man was able to think about his life in its
last seconds, imagine what his final thoughts must have been!"</p>

<p id="id01714">As he spoke, Captain Nemo seemed deeply moved, an emotion I felt
was to his credit.</p>

<p id="id01715">Then, chart in hand, we returned to the deeds of the French navigator:
his voyages to circumnavigate the globe, his double attempt at
the South Pole, which led to his discovery of the Adélie Coast
and the Louis-Philippe Peninsula, finally his hydrographic surveys
of the chief islands in Oceania.</p>

<p id="id01716">"What your d'Urville did on the surface of the sea," Captain Nemo
told me, "I've done in the ocean's interior, but more easily,
more completely than he.  Constantly tossed about by hurricanes,
the Zealous and the new Astrolabe couldn't compare with the Nautilus,
a quiet work room truly at rest in the midst of the waters!"</p>

<p id="id01717">"Even so, captain," I said, "there is one major similarity between<br/>

Dumont d'Urville's sloops of war and the Nautilus."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01718">"What's that, sir?"</p>

<p id="id01719">"Like them, the Nautilus has run aground!"</p>

<p id="id01720">"The Nautilus is not aground, sir," Captain Nemo replied icily.
"The Nautilus was built to rest on the ocean floor, and I don't
need to undertake the arduous labors, the maneuvers d'Urville
had to attempt in order to float off his sloops of war.
The Zealous and the new Astrolabe wellnigh perished, but my Nautilus
is in no danger.  Tomorrow, on the day stated and at the hour stated,
the tide will peacefully lift it off, and it will resume its navigating
through the seas."</p>

<p id="id01721">"Captain," I said, "I don't doubt—"</p>

<p id="id01722">"Tomorrow," Captain Nemo added, standing up, "tomorrow at
2:40 in the afternoon, the Nautilus will float off and exit
the Torres Strait undamaged."</p>

<p id="id01723">Pronouncing these words in an extremely sharp tone, Captain Nemo gave
me a curt bow.  This was my dismissal, and I reentered my stateroom.</p>

<p id="id01724">There I found Conseil, who wanted to know the upshot of my interview
with the captain.</p>

<p id="id01725">"My boy," I replied, "when I expressed the belief that these Papuan
natives were a threat to his Nautilus, the captain answered
me with great irony.  So I've just one thing to say to you:
have faith in him and sleep in peace."</p>

<p id="id01726">"Master has no need for my services?"</p>

<p id="id01727">"No, my friend.  What's Ned Land up to?"</p>

<p id="id01728">"Begging master's indulgence," Conseil replied, "but our friend Ned
is concocting a kangaroo pie that will be the eighth wonder!"</p>

<p id="id01729">I was left to myself; I went to bed but slept pretty poorly.
I kept hearing noises from the savages, who were stamping on
the platform and letting out deafening yells.  The night passed
in this way, without the crew ever emerging from their usual inertia.
They were no more disturbed by the presence of these man-eaters
than soldiers in an armored fortress are troubled by ants running
over the armor plate.</p>

<p id="id01730">I got up at six o'clock in the morning.  The hatches weren't open.
So the air inside hadn't been renewed; but the air tanks were kept
full for any eventuality and would function appropriately to shoot
a few cubic meters of oxygen into the Nautilus's thin atmosphere.</p>

<p id="id01731">I worked in my stateroom until noon without seeing Captain Nemo
even for an instant.  Nobody on board seemed to be making any
preparations for departure.</p>

<p id="id01732">I still waited for a while, then I made my way to the main lounge.
Its timepiece marked 2:30. In ten minutes the tide would reach its
maximum elevation, and if Captain Nemo hadn't made a rash promise,
the Nautilus would immediately break free.  If not, many months
might pass before it could leave its coral bed.</p>

<p id="id01733">But some preliminary vibrations could soon be felt over the boat's hull.
I heard its plating grind against the limestone roughness of
that coral base.</p>

<p id="id01734">At 2:35 Captain Nemo appeared in the lounge.</p>

<p id="id01735">"We're about to depart," he said.</p>

<p id="id01736">"Ah!"  I put in.</p>

<p id="id01737">"I've given orders to open the hatches."</p>

<p id="id01738" style="margin-top: 4em">"What about the Papuans?"</p>

<p id="id01739">"What about them?"  Captain Nemo replied, with a light shrug
of his shoulders.</p>

<p id="id01740">"Won't they come inside the Nautilus?"</p>

<p id="id01741">"How will they manage that?"</p>

<p id="id01742">"By jumping down the hatches you're about to open."</p>

<p id="id01743">"Professor Aronnax," Captain Nemo replied serenely, "the Nautilus's
hatches aren't to be entered in that fashion even when they're open."</p>

<p id="id01744">I gaped at the captain.</p>

<p id="id01745">"You don't understand?" he said to me.</p>

<p id="id01746">"Not in the least."</p>

<p id="id01747">"Well, come along and you'll see!"</p>

<p id="id01748">I headed to the central companionway.  There, very puzzled,
Ned Land and Conseil watched the crewmen opening the hatches,
while a frightful clamor and furious shouts resounded outside.</p>

<p id="id01749">The hatch lids fell back onto the outer plating.
Twenty horrible faces appeared.  But when the first islander laid
hands on the companionway railing, he was flung backward by some
invisible power, lord knows what!  He ran off, howling in terror
and wildly prancing around.</p>

<p id="id01750">Ten of his companions followed him.  All ten met the same fate.</p>

<p id="id01751">Conseil was in ecstasy.  Carried away by his violent instincts,
Ned Land leaped up the companionway.  But as soon as his hands
seized the railing, he was thrown backward in his turn.</p>

<p id="id01752">"Damnation!" he exclaimed.  "I've been struck by a lightning bolt!"</p>

<p id="id01753">These words explained everything to me.  It wasn't just a railing
that led to the platform, it was a metal cable fully charged with
the ship's electricity.  Anyone who touched it got a fearsome shock—
and such a shock would have been fatal if Captain Nemo had thrown
the full current from his equipment into this conducting cable!
It could honestly be said that he had stretched between himself and his
assailants a network of electricity no one could clear with impunity.</p>

<p id="id01754">Meanwhile, crazed with terror, the unhinged Papuans beat a retreat.
As for us, half laughing, we massaged and comforted poor Ned Land,
who was swearing like one possessed.</p>

<p id="id01755">But just then, lifted off by the tide's final undulations, the Nautilus
left its coral bed at exactly that fortieth minute pinpointed
by the captain.  Its propeller churned the waves with lazy majesty.
Gathering speed little by little, the ship navigated on the surface
of the ocean, and safe and sound, it left behind the dangerous
narrows of the Torres Strait.</p>

<h4 id="id01756" style="margin-top: 2em">CHAPTER 23</h4>

<p id="id01757">"Aegri Somnia"*</p>

<p id="id01758">*Latin: "troubled dreams."  Ed.</p>

<p id="id01759" style="margin-top: 2em">THE FOLLOWING DAY, January 10, the Nautilus resumed its travels
in midwater but at a remarkable speed that I estimated to be at
least thirty-five miles per hour.  The propeller was going so fast
I could neither follow nor count its revolutions.</p>

<p id="id01760">I thought about how this marvelous electric force not only
gave motion, heat, and light to the Nautilus but even protected it
against outside attack, transforming it into a sacred ark no profane
hand could touch without being blasted; my wonderment was boundless,
and it went from the submersible itself to the engineer who
had created it.</p>

<p id="id01761">We were traveling due west and on January 11 we doubled Cape Wessel,
located in longitude 135 degrees and latitude 10 degrees north,
the western tip of the Gulf of Carpentaria.  Reefs were still
numerous but more widely scattered and were fixed on the chart
with the greatest accuracy.  The Nautilus easily avoided
the Money breakers to port and the Victoria reefs to starboard,
positioned at longitude 130 degrees on the tenth parallel,
which we went along rigorously.</p>

<p id="id01762">On January 13, arriving in the Timor Sea, Captain Nemo raised
the island of that name at longitude 122 degrees.  This island,
whose surface area measures 1,625 square leagues, is governed by rajahs.
These aristocrats deem themselves the sons of crocodiles, in other words,
descendants with the most exalted origins to which a human
being can lay claim.  Accordingly, their scaly ancestors infest
the island's rivers and are the subjects of special veneration.
They are sheltered, nurtured, flattered, pampered, and offered
a ritual diet of nubile maidens; and woe to the foreigner who lifts
a finger against these sacred saurians.</p>

<p id="id01763">But the Nautilus wanted nothing to do with these nasty animals.
Timor Island was visible for barely an instant at noon while the chief
officer determined his position.  I also caught only a glimpse
of little Roti Island, part of this same group, whose women have a
well-established reputation for beauty in the Malaysian marketplace.</p>

<p id="id01764">After our position fix, the Nautilus's latitude bearings were modulated
to the southwest.  Our prow pointed to the Indian Ocean.  Where would
Captain Nemo's fancies take us?  Would he head up to the shores
of Asia?  Would he pull nearer to the beaches of Europe?  Unlikely choices
for a man who avoided populated areas!  So would he go down south?
Would he double the Cape of Good Hope, then Cape Horn, and push
on to the Antarctic pole?  Finally, would he return to the seas
of the Pacific, where his Nautilus could navigate freely and easily?
Time would tell.</p>

<p id="id01765">After cruising along the Cartier, Hibernia, Seringapatam, and Scott reefs,
the solid element's last exertions against the liquid element,
we were beyond all sight of shore by January 14.  The Nautilus
slowed down in an odd manner, and very unpredictable in its ways,
it sometimes swam in the midst of the waters, sometimes drifted
on their surface.</p>

<p id="id01766">During this phase of our voyage, Captain Nemo conducted interesting
experiments on the different temperatures in various strata of the sea.
Under ordinary conditions, such readings are obtained using
some pretty complicated instruments whose findings are dubious
to say the least, whether they're thermometric sounding lines,
whose glass often shatters under the water's pressure, or those devices
based on the varying resistance of metals to electric currents.
The results so obtained can't be adequately double-checked. By contrast,
Captain Nemo would seek the sea's temperature by going himself
into its depths, and when he placed his thermometer in contact
with the various layers of liquid, he found the sought-for degree
immediately and with certainty.</p>

<p id="id01767">And so, by loading up its ballast tanks, or by sinking obliquely
with its slanting fins, the Nautilus successively reached
depths of 3,000, 4,000, 5,000, 7,000, 9,000, and 10,000 meters,
and the ultimate conclusion from these experiments was that,
in all latitudes, the sea had a permanent temperature of 4.5 degrees
centigrade at a depth of 1,000 meters.</p>

<p id="id01768">I watched these experiments with the most intense fascination.
Captain Nemo brought a real passion to them.  I often wondered
why he took these observations.  Were they for the benefit
of his fellow man?  It was unlikely, because sooner or later
his work would perish with him in some unknown sea!
Unless he intended the results of his experiments for me.
But that meant this strange voyage of mine would come to an end,
and no such end was in sight.</p>

<p id="id01769">Be that as it may, Captain Nemo also introduced me to the different
data he had obtained on the relative densities of the water
in our globe's chief seas.  From this news I derived some personal
enlightenment having nothing to do with science.</p>

<p id="id01770">It happened the morning of January 15.  The captain, with whom I
was strolling on the platform, asked me if I knew how salt water
differs in density from sea to sea.  I said no, adding that there
was a lack of rigorous scientific observations on this subject.</p>

<p id="id01771">"I've taken such observations," he told me, "and I can vouch
for their reliability."</p>

<p id="id01772">"Fine," I replied, "but the Nautilus lives in a separate world,
and the secrets of its scientists don't make their way ashore."</p>

<p id="id01773">"You're right, professor," he told me after a few moments of silence.
"This is a separate world.  It's as alien to the earth as the planets
accompanying our globe around the sun, and we'll never become
familiar with the work of scientists on Saturn or Jupiter.  But since
fate has linked our two lives, I can reveal the results of my
observations to you."</p>

<p id="id01774">"I'm all attention, captain."</p>

<p id="id01775">"You're aware, professor, that salt water is denser than fresh water,
but this density isn't uniform.  In essence, if I represent
the density of fresh water by 1.000, then I find 1.028 for
the waters of the Atlantic, 1.026 for the waters of the Pacific,
1.030 for the waters of the Mediterranean—"</p>

<p id="id01776">Aha, I thought, so he ventures into the Mediterranean?</p>

<p id="id01777">"—1.018 for the waters of the Ionian Sea, and 1.029 for the waters
of the Adriatic."</p>

<p id="id01778">Assuredly, the Nautilus didn't avoid the heavily traveled seas
of Europe, and from this insight I concluded that the ship would
take us back—perhaps very soon—to more civilized shores.
I expected Ned Land to greet this news with unfeigned satisfaction.</p>

<p id="id01779">For several days our work hours were spent in all sorts of experiments,
on the degree of salinity in waters of different depths,
or on their electric properties, coloration, and transparency,
and in every instance Captain Nemo displayed an ingenuity equaled
only by his graciousness toward me.  Then I saw no more of him
for some days and again lived on board in seclusion.</p>

<p id="id01780">On January 16 the Nautilus seemed to have fallen asleep just a few meters
beneath the surface of the water.  Its electric equipment had been
turned off, and the motionless propeller let it ride with the waves.
I assumed that the crew were busy with interior repairs,
required by the engine's strenuous mechanical action.</p>

<p id="id01781">My companions and I then witnessed an unusual sight.
The panels in the lounge were open, and since the Nautilus's beacon
was off, a hazy darkness reigned in the midst of the waters.
Covered with heavy clouds, the stormy sky gave only the faintest
light to the ocean's upper strata.</p>

<p id="id01782">I was observing the state of the sea under these conditions,
and even the largest fish were nothing more than ill-defined shadows,
when the Nautilus was suddenly transferred into broad daylight.
At first I thought the beacon had gone back on and was casting
its electric light into the liquid mass.  I was mistaken,
and after a hasty examination I discovered my error.</p>

<p id="id01783">The Nautilus had drifted into the midst of some phosphorescent
strata, which, in this darkness, came off as positively dazzling.
This effect was caused by myriads of tiny, luminous animals
whose brightness increased when they glided over the metal hull
of our submersible.  In the midst of these luminous sheets of water,
I then glimpsed flashes of light, like those seen inside a blazing
furnace from streams of molten lead or from masses of metal
brought to a white heat—flashes so intense that certain areas
of the light became shadows by comparison, in a fiery setting
from which every shadow should seemingly have been banished.
No, this was no longer the calm emission of our usual lighting!
This light throbbed with unprecedented vigor and activity!
You sensed that it was alive!</p>

<p id="id01784">In essence, it was a cluster of countless open-sea infusoria,
of noctiluca an eighth of an inch wide, actual globules of
transparent jelly equipped with a threadlike tentacle, up to 25,000
of which have been counted in thirty cubic centimeters of water.
And the power of their light was increased by those glimmers
unique to medusas, starfish, common jellyfish, angel-wing clams,
and other phosphorescent zoophytes, which were saturated with grease
from organic matter decomposed by the sea, and perhaps with mucus
secreted by fish.</p>

<p id="id01785">For several hours the Nautilus drifted in this brilliant tide,
and our wonderment grew when we saw huge marine animals
cavorting in it, like the fire-dwelling salamanders of myth.
In the midst of these flames that didn't burn, I could see swift,
elegant porpoises, the tireless pranksters of the seas,
and sailfish three meters long, those shrewd heralds of hurricanes,
whose fearsome broadswords sometimes banged against the lounge window.
Then smaller fish appeared:  miscellaneous triggerfish,
leather jacks, unicornfish, and a hundred others that left stripes
on this luminous atmosphere in their course.</p>

<p id="id01786">Some magic lay behind this dazzling sight!  Perhaps some
atmospheric condition had intensified this phenomenon?
Perhaps a storm had been unleashed on the surface of the waves?
But only a few meters down, the Nautilus felt no tempest's fury,
and the ship rocked peacefully in the midst of the calm waters.</p>

<p id="id01787">And so it went, some new wonder constantly delighting us.
Conseil observed and classified his zoophytes, articulates, mollusks,
and fish.  The days passed quickly, and I no longer kept track of them.
Ned, as usual, kept looking for changes of pace from our standard fare.
Like actual snails, we were at home in our shell, and I can vouch
that it's easy to turn into a full-fledged snail.</p>

<p id="id01788">So this way of living began to seem simple and natural to us,
and we no longer envisioned a different lifestyle on the surface
of the planet earth, when something happened to remind us of
our strange circumstances.</p>

<p id="id01789">On January 18 the Nautilus lay in longitude 105 degrees and latitude 15
degrees south.  The weather was threatening, the sea rough and billowy.
The wind was blowing a strong gust from the east.  The barometer,
which had been falling for some days, forecast an approaching
struggle of the elements.</p>

<p id="id01790">I had climbed onto the platform just as the chief officer was taking
his readings of hour angles.  Out of habit I waited for him to pronounce
his daily phrase.  But that day it was replaced by a different phrase,
just as incomprehensible.  Almost at once I saw Captain Nemo appear,
lift his spyglass, and inspect the horizon.</p>

<p id="id01791">For some minutes the captain stood motionless, rooted to the spot
contained within the field of his lens.  Then he lowered his
spyglass and exchanged about ten words with his chief officer.
The latter seemed to be in the grip of an excitement he tried in vain
to control.  More in command of himself, Captain Nemo remained cool.
Furthermore, he seemed to be raising certain objections that his
chief officer kept answering with flat assurances.  At least that's
what I gathered from their differences in tone and gesture.</p>

<p id="id01792">As for me, I stared industriously in the direction under observation
but without spotting a thing.  Sky and water merged into a perfectly
clean horizon line.</p>

<p id="id01793">Meanwhile Captain Nemo strolled from one end of the platform
to the other, not glancing at me, perhaps not even seeing me.
His step was firm but less regular than usual.  Sometimes he
would stop, cross his arms over his chest, and observe the sea.
What could he be looking for over that immense expanse?
By then the Nautilus lay hundreds of miles from the nearest coast!</p>

<p id="id01794">The chief officer kept lifting his spyglass and stubbornly
examining the horizon, walking up and down, stamping his foot,
in his nervous agitation a sharp contrast to his superior.</p>

<p id="id01795">But this mystery would inevitably be cleared up, and soon,
because Captain Nemo gave orders to increase speed; at once the engine
stepped up its drive power, setting the propeller in swifter rotation.</p>

<p id="id01796">Just then the chief officer drew the captain's attention anew.
The latter interrupted his strolling and aimed his spyglass
at the point indicated.  He observed it a good while.
As for me, deeply puzzled, I went below to the lounge and brought
back an excellent long-range telescope I habitually used.
Leaning my elbows on the beacon housing, which jutted from the stern
of the platform, I got set to scour that whole stretch of sky and sea.</p>

<p id="id01797">But no sooner had I peered into the eyepiece than the instrument
was snatched from my hands.</p>

<p id="id01798">I spun around.  Captain Nemo was standing before me, but I almost
didn't recognize him.  His facial features were transfigured.
Gleaming with dark fire, his eyes had shrunk beneath his frowning brow.
His teeth were half bared.  His rigid body, clenched fists,
and head drawn between his shoulders, all attested to a fierce
hate breathing from every pore.  He didn't move.  My spyglass fell
from his hand and rolled at his feet.</p>

<p id="id01799">Had I accidentally caused these symptoms of anger?  Did this
incomprehensible individual think I had detected some secret
forbidden to guests on the Nautilus?</p>

<p id="id01800">No!  I wasn't the subject of his hate because he wasn't even looking
at me; his eyes stayed stubbornly focused on that inscrutable point
of the horizon.</p>

<p id="id01801">Finally Captain Nemo regained his self-control. His facial appearance,
so profoundly changed, now resumed its usual calm.  He addressed
a few words to his chief officer in their strange language,
then he turned to me:</p>

<p id="id01802">"Professor Aronnax," he told me in a tone of some urgency, "I ask
that you now honor one of the binding agreements between us."</p>

<p id="id01803">"Which one, captain?"</p>

<p id="id01804">"You and your companions must be placed in confinement until I see
fit to set you free."</p>

<p id="id01805">"You're in command," I answered, gaping at him.  "But may I address
a question to you?"</p>

<p id="id01806">"You may not, sir."</p>

<p id="id01807">After that, I stopped objecting and started obeying,
since resistance was useless.</p>

<p id="id01808">I went below to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and Conseil,
and I informed them of the captain's decision.  I'll let the reader
decide how this news was received by the Canadian.  In any case,
there was no time for explanations.  Four crewmen were waiting
at the door, and they led us to the cell where we had spent our
first night aboard the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id01809">Ned Land tried to lodge a complaint, but the only answer he got
was a door shut in his face.</p>

<p id="id01810">"Will master tell me what this means?"  Conseil asked me.</p>

<p id="id01811">I told my companions what had happened.  They were as astonished
as I was, but no wiser.</p>

<p id="id01812">Then I sank into deep speculation, and Captain Nemo's strange facial
seizure kept haunting me.  I was incapable of connecting two ideas
in logical order, and I had strayed into the most absurd hypotheses,
when I was snapped out of my mental struggles by these words
from Ned Land:</p>

<p id="id01813">"Well, look here!  Lunch is served!"</p>

<p id="id01814">Indeed, the table had been laid.  Apparently Captain Nemo had given
this order at the same time he commanded the Nautilus to pick up speed.</p>

<p id="id01815">"Will master allow me to make him a recommendation?"<br/>

Conseil asked me.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01816">"Yes, my boy," I replied.</p>

<p id="id01817">"Well, master needs to eat his lunch!  It's prudent, because we
have no idea what the future holds."</p>

<p id="id01818">"You're right, Conseil."</p>

<p id="id01819">"Unfortunately," Ned Land said, "they've only given us the standard menu."</p>

<p id="id01820">"Ned my friend," Conseil answered, "what would you say if they'd
given us no lunch at all?"</p>

<p id="id01821">This dose of sanity cut the harpooner's complaints clean off.</p>

<p id="id01822">We sat down at the table.  Our meal proceeded pretty much in silence.
I ate very little.  Conseil, everlastingly prudent, "force-fed" himself;
and despite the menu, Ned Land didn't waste a bite.  Then, lunch over,
each of us propped himself in a corner.</p>

<p id="id01823">Just then the luminous globe lighting our cell went out,
leaving us in profound darkness.  Ned Land soon dozed off,
and to my astonishment, Conseil also fell into a heavy slumber.
I was wondering what could have caused this urgent need
for sleep, when I felt a dense torpor saturate my brain.
I tried to keep my eyes open, but they closed in spite of me.
I was in the grip of anguished hallucinations.  Obviously some
sleep-inducing substance had been laced into the food we'd just eaten!
So imprisonment wasn't enough to conceal Captain Nemo's plans from us—
sleep was needed as well!</p>

<p id="id01824">Then I heard the hatches close.  The sea's undulations,
which had been creating a gentle rocking motion, now ceased.
Had the Nautilus left the surface of the ocean?  Was it reentering
the motionless strata deep in the sea?</p>

<p id="id01825">I tried to fight off this drowsiness.  It was impossible.
My breathing grew weaker.  I felt a mortal chill freeze
my dull, nearly paralyzed limbs.  Like little domes of lead,
my lids fell over my eyes.  I couldn't raise them.
A morbid sleep, full of hallucinations, seized my whole being.
Then the visions disappeared and left me in utter oblivion.</p>
