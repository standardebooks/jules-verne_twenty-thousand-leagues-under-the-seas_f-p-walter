<p id="id03272">Accident or Incident?</p>

<p id="id03273" style="margin-top: 2em">THE NEXT DAY, March 22, at six o'clock in the morning, preparations for
departure began.  The last gleams of twilight were melting into night.
The cold was brisk.  The constellations were glittering with
startling intensity.  The wonderful Southern Cross, polar star
of the Antarctic regions, twinkled at its zenith.</p>

<p id="id03274">The thermometer marked -12 degrees centigrade, and a fresh breeze
left a sharp nip in the air.  Ice floes were increasing over
the open water.  The sea was starting to congeal everywhere.
Numerous blackish patches were spreading over its surface,
announcing the imminent formation of fresh ice.  Obviously this
southernmost basin froze over during its six-month winter and became
utterly inaccessible.  What happened to the whales during this period?
No doubt they went beneath the Ice Bank to find more feasible seas.
As for seals and walruses, they were accustomed to living
in the harshest climates and stayed on in these icy waterways.
These animals know by instinct how to gouge holes in the ice fields
and keep them continually open; they go to these holes to breathe.
Once the birds have migrated northward to escape the cold,
these marine mammals remain as sole lords of the polar continent.</p>

<p id="id03275">Meanwhile the ballast tanks filled with water and the Nautilus
sank slowly.  At a depth of 1,000 feet, it stopped.  Its propeller churned
the waves and it headed due north at a speed of fifteen miles per hour.
Near the afternoon it was already cruising under the immense frozen
carapace of the Ice Bank.</p>

<p id="id03276">As a precaution, the panels in the lounge stayed closed,
because the Nautilus's hull could run afoul of some submerged block
of ice.  So I spent the day putting my notes into final form.
My mind was completely wrapped up in my memories of the pole.
We had reached that inaccessible spot without facing exhaustion
or danger, as if our seagoing passenger carriage had glided there on
railroad tracks.  And now we had actually started our return journey.
Did it still have comparable surprises in store for me?  I felt sure
it did, so inexhaustible is this series of underwater wonders!
As it was, in the five and a half months since fate had brought us
on board, we had cleared 14,000 leagues, and over this track longer
than the earth's equator, so many fascinating or frightening incidents
had beguiled our voyage:  that hunting trip in the Crespo forests,
our running aground in the Torres Strait, the coral cemetery,
the pearl fisheries of Ceylon, the Arabic tunnel, the fires of Santorini,
those millions in the Bay of Vigo, Atlantis, the South Pole!  During the
night all these memories crossed over from one dream to the next,
not giving my brain a moment's rest.</p>

<p id="id03277">At three o'clock in the morning, I was awakened by a violent collision.
I sat up in bed, listening in the darkness, and then was suddenly
hurled into the middle of my stateroom.  Apparently the Nautilus
had gone aground, then heeled over sharply.</p>

<p id="id03278">Leaning against the walls, I dragged myself down the gangways
to the lounge, whose ceiling lights were on.  The furniture had been
knocked over.  Fortunately the glass cases were solidly secured
at the base and had stood fast.  Since we were no longer vertical,
the starboard pictures were glued to the tapestries, while those
to port had their lower edges hanging a foot away from the wall.
So the Nautilus was lying on its starboard side, completely
stationary to boot.</p>

<p id="id03279">In its interior I heard the sound of footsteps and muffled voices.
But Captain Nemo didn't appear.  Just as I was about to leave
the lounge, Ned Land and Conseil entered.</p>

<p id="id03280">"What happened?"  I instantly said to them.</p>

<p id="id03281">"I came to ask master that," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id03282">"Damnation!" the Canadian exclaimed.  "I know full well what happened!<br/>

The Nautilus has gone aground, and judging from the way it's listing,<br/>

I don't think it'll pull through like that first time in<br/>

the Torres Strait."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03283">"But," I asked, "are we at least back on the surface of the sea?"</p>

<p id="id03284">"We have no idea," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id03285">"It's easy to find out," I answered.</p>

<p id="id03286">I consulted the pressure gauge.  Much to my surprise, it indicated
a depth of 360 meters.</p>

<p id="id03287">"What's the meaning of this?"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id03288">"We must confer with Captain Nemo," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id03289">"But where do we find him?"  Ned Land asked.</p>

<p id="id03290">"Follow me," I told my two companions.</p>

<p id="id03291">We left the lounge.  Nobody in the library.  Nobody by the central
companionway or the crew's quarters.  I assumed that Captain Nemo
was stationed in the pilothouse.  Best to wait.  The three of us
returned to the lounge.</p>

<p id="id03292">I'll skip over the Canadian's complaints.  He had good grounds
for an outburst.  I didn't answer him back, letting him blow off
all the steam he wanted.</p>

<p id="id03293">We had been left to ourselves for twenty minutes, trying to detect
the tiniest noises inside the Nautilus, when Captain Nemo entered.
He didn't seem to see us.  His facial features, usually so emotionless,
revealed a certain uneasiness.  He studied the compass and pressure
gauge in silence, then went and put his finger on the world map
at a spot in the sector depicting the southernmost seas.</p>

<p id="id03294">I hesitated to interrupt him.  But some moments later, when he turned
to me, I threw back at him a phrase he had used in the Torres Strait:</p>

<p id="id03295">"An incident, captain?"</p>

<p id="id03296">"No, sir," he replied, "this time an accident."</p>

<p id="id03297">"Serious?"</p>

<p id="id03298">"Perhaps."</p>

<p id="id03299">"Is there any immediate danger?"</p>

<p id="id03300">"No."</p>

<p id="id03301">"The Nautilus has run aground?"</p>

<p id="id03302">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id03303">"And this accident came about . . . ?"</p>

<p id="id03304">"Through nature's unpredictability not man's incapacity.
No errors were committed in our maneuvers.  Nevertheless, we can't
prevent a loss of balance from taking its toll.  One may defy
human laws, but no one can withstand the laws of nature."</p>

<p id="id03305">Captain Nemo had picked an odd time to philosophize.  All in all,
this reply told me nothing.</p>

<p id="id03306">"May I learn, sir," I asked him, "what caused this accident?"</p>

<p id="id03307">"An enormous block of ice, an entire mountain, has toppled over,"
he answered me.  "When an iceberg is eroded at the base by warmer
waters or by repeated collisions, its center of gravity rises.
Then it somersaults, it turns completely upside down.
That's what happened here.  When it overturned, one of these
blocks hit the Nautilus as it was cruising under the waters.
Sliding under our hull, this block then raised us with irresistible power,
lifting us into less congested strata where we now lie on our side."</p>

<p id="id03308">"But can't we float the Nautilus clear by emptying its ballast tanks,
to regain our balance?"</p>

<p id="id03309">"That, sir, is being done right now.  You can hear the pumps working.
Look at the needle on the pressure gauge.  It indicates that the Nautilus
is rising, but this block of ice is rising with us, and until some
obstacle halts its upward movement, our position won't change."</p>

<p id="id03310">Indeed, the Nautilus kept the same heel to starboard.<br/>

No doubt it would straighten up once the block came to a halt.<br/>

But before that happened, who knew if we might not hit the underbelly<br/>

of the Ice Bank and be hideously squeezed between two frozen surfaces?<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03311">I mused on all the consequences of this situation.  Captain Nemo
didn't stop studying the pressure gauge.  Since the toppling
of this iceberg, the Nautilus had risen about 150 feet, but it
still stayed at the same angle to the perpendicular.</p>

<p id="id03312">Suddenly a slight movement could be felt over the hull.<br/>

Obviously the Nautilus was straightening a bit.  Objects hanging<br/>

in the lounge were visibly returning to their normal positions.<br/>

The walls were approaching the vertical.  Nobody said a word.<br/>

Hearts pounding, we could see and feel the ship righting itself.<br/>

The floor was becoming horizontal beneath our feet.<br/>

Ten minutes went by.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03313">"Finally, we're upright!"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id03314">"Yes," Captain Nemo said, heading to the lounge door.</p>

<p id="id03315">"But will we float off?"  I asked him.</p>

<p id="id03316">"Certainly," he replied, "since the ballast tanks aren't yet empty,
and when they are, the Nautilus must rise to the surface of the sea."</p>

<p id="id03317">The captain went out, and soon I saw that at his orders, the Nautilus
had halted its upward movement.  In fact, it soon would have hit
the underbelly of the Ice Bank, but it had stopped in time and was
floating in midwater.</p>

<p id="id03318">"That was a close call!"  Conseil then said.</p>

<p id="id03319">"Yes.  We could have been crushed between these masses of ice,
or at least imprisoned between them.  And then, with no way to renew
our air supply. . . . Yes, that was a close call!"</p>

<p id="id03320">"If it's over with!"  Ned Land muttered.</p>

<p id="id03321">I was unwilling to get into a pointless argument with the Canadian
and didn't reply.  Moreover, the panels opened just then,
and the outside light burst through the uncovered windows.</p>

<p id="id03322">We were fully afloat, as I have said; but on both sides of the Nautilus,
about ten meters away, there rose dazzling walls of ice.
There also were walls above and below.  Above, because the
Ice Bank's underbelly spread over us like an immense ceiling.
Below, because the somersaulting block, shifting little by little,
had found points of purchase on both side walls and had gotten
jammed between them.  The Nautilus was imprisoned in a genuine
tunnel of ice about twenty meters wide and filled with quiet water.
So the ship could easily exit by going either ahead or astern,
sinking a few hundred meters deeper, and then taking an open
passageway beneath the Ice Bank.</p>

<p id="id03323">The ceiling lights were off, yet the lounge was still brightly lit.
This was due to the reflecting power of the walls of ice,
which threw the beams of our beacon right back at us.  Words cannot
describe the effects produced by our galvanic rays on these huge,
whimsically sculpted blocks, whose every angle, ridge, and facet gave
off a different glow depending on the nature of the veins running
inside the ice.  It was a dazzling mine of gems, in particular
sapphires and emeralds, whose jets of blue and green crisscrossed.
Here and there, opaline hues of infinite subtlety raced among sparks
of light that were like so many fiery diamonds, their brilliance
more than any eye could stand.  The power of our beacon was increased
a hundredfold, like a lamp shining through the biconvex lenses
of a world-class lighthouse.</p>

<p id="id03324">"How beautiful!"  Conseil exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id03325">"Yes," I said, "it's a wonderful sight!  Isn't it, Ned?"</p>

<p id="id03326">"Oh damnation, yes!"  Ned Land shot back.  "It's superb!<br/>

I'm furious that I have to admit it.  Nobody has ever seen the like.<br/>

But this sight could cost us dearly.  And in all honesty, I think<br/>

we're looking at things God never intended for human eyes."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03327">Ned was right.  It was too beautiful.  All at once a yell from<br/>

Conseil made me turn around.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03328">"What is it?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id03329">"Master must close his eyes!  Master mustn't look!"</p>

<p id="id03330">With that, Conseil clapped his hands over his eyes.</p>

<p id="id03331">"But what's wrong, my boy?"</p>

<p id="id03332">"I've been dazzled, struck blind!"</p>

<p id="id03333">Involuntarily my eyes flew to the window, but I couldn't stand
the fire devouring it.</p>

<p id="id03334">I realized what had happened.  The Nautilus had just started off
at great speed.  All the tranquil glimmers of the ice walls had then
changed into blazing streaks.  The sparkles from these myriads of
diamonds were merging with each other.  Swept along by its propeller,
the Nautilus was traveling through a sheath of flashing light.</p>

<p id="id03335">Then the panels in the lounge closed.  We kept our hands over our eyes,
which were utterly saturated with those concentric gleams that
swirl before the retina when sunlight strikes it too intensely.
It took some time to calm our troubled vision.</p>

<p id="id03336">Finally we lowered our hands.</p>

<p id="id03337">"Ye gods, I never would have believed it," Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id03338">"And I still don't believe it!" the Canadian shot back.</p>

<p id="id03339">"When we return to shore, jaded from all these natural wonders,"
Conseil added, "think how we'll look down on those pitiful land masses,
those puny works of man!  No, the civilized world won't be good
enough for us!"</p>

<p id="id03340">Such words from the lips of this emotionless Flemish boy showed
that our enthusiasm was near the boiling point.  But the Canadian
didn't fail to throw his dram of cold water over us.</p>

<p id="id03341">"The civilized world!" he said, shaking his head.  "Don't worry,<br/>

Conseil my friend, we're never going back to that world!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03342">By this point it was five o'clock in the morning.
Just then there was a collision in the Nautilus's bow.
I realized that its spur had just bumped a block of ice.
It must have been a faulty maneuver because this underwater tunnel
was obstructed by such blocks and didn't make for easy navigating.
So I had assumed that Captain Nemo, in adjusting his course, would go
around each obstacle or would hug the walls and follow the windings
of the tunnel.  In either case our forward motion wouldn't receive
an absolute check.  Nevertheless, contrary to my expectations,
the Nautilus definitely began to move backward.</p>

<p id="id03343">"We're going astern?"  Conseil said.</p>

<p id="id03344">"Yes," I replied.  "Apparently the tunnel has no way out at this end."</p>

<p id="id03345">"And so . . . ?"</p>

<p id="id03346">"So," I said, "our maneuvers are quite simple.  We'll return in our
tracks and go out the southern opening.  That's all."</p>

<p id="id03347">As I spoke, I tried to sound more confident than I really felt.
Meanwhile the Nautilus accelerated its backward movement, and running
with propeller in reverse, it swept us along at great speed.</p>

<p id="id03348">"This'll mean a delay," Ned said.</p>

<p id="id03349">"What are a few hours more or less, so long as we get out."</p>

<p id="id03350">"Yes," Ned Land repeated, "so long as we get out!"</p>

<p id="id03351">I strolled for a little while from the lounge into the library.
My companions kept their seats and didn't move.  Soon I threw myself
down on a couch and picked up a book, which my eyes skimmed mechanically.</p>

<p id="id03352">A quarter of an hour later, Conseil approached me, saying:</p>

<p id="id03353">"Is it deeply fascinating, this volume master is reading?"</p>

<p id="id03354">"Tremendously fascinating," I replied.</p>

<p id="id03355">"I believe it.  Master is reading his own book!"</p>

<p id="id03356">"My own book?"</p>

<p id="id03357">Indeed, my hands were holding my own work on the great ocean depths.<br/>

I hadn't even suspected.  I closed the book and resumed my strolling.<br/>

Ned and Conseil stood up to leave.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03358">"Stay here, my friends," I said, stopping them.  "Let's stay together
until we're out of this blind alley."</p>

<p id="id03359">"As master wishes," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id03360">The hours passed.  I often studied the instruments hanging on
the lounge wall.  The pressure gauge indicated that the Nautilus
stayed at a constant depth of 300 meters, the compass that it kept
heading south, the log that it was traveling at a speed of twenty
miles per hour, an excessive speed in such a cramped area.
But Captain Nemo knew that by this point there was no such thing
as too fast, since minutes were now worth centuries.</p>

<p id="id03361">At 8:25 a second collision took place.  This time astern.<br/>

I grew pale.  My companions came over.  I clutched Conseil's hand.<br/>

Our eyes questioned each other, and more directly than if our thoughts<br/>

had been translated into words.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03362">Just then the captain entered the lounge.  I went to him.</p>

<p id="id03363">"Our path is barred to the south?"  I asked him.</p>

<p id="id03364">"Yes, sir.  When it overturned, that iceberg closed off every exit."</p>

<p id="id03365">"We're boxed in?"</p>

<p id="id03366">"Yes."</p>

<h1 id="id03367" style="margin-top: 16em">CHAPTER 16</h1>

<p id="id03368">Shortage of Air</p>

<p id="id03369" style="margin-top: 2em">CONSEQUENTLY, above, below, and around the Nautilus, there were<br/>

impenetrable frozen walls.  We were the Ice Bank's prisoners!<br/>

The Canadian banged a table with his fearsome fist.  Conseil kept still.<br/>

I stared at the captain.  His face had resumed its usual emotionlessness.<br/>

He crossed his arms.  He pondered.  The Nautilus did not stir.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03370">The captain then broke into speech:</p>

<p id="id03371">"Gentlemen," he said in a calm voice, "there are two ways of dying
under the conditions in which we're placed."</p>

<p id="id03372">This inexplicable individual acted like a mathematics professor
working out a problem for his pupils.</p>

<p id="id03373">"The first way," he went on, "is death by crushing.  The second
is death by asphyxiation.  I don't mention the possibility of death
by starvation because the Nautilus's provisions will certainly last
longer than we will.  Therefore, let's concentrate on our chances
of being crushed or asphyxiated."</p>

<p id="id03374">"As for asphyxiation, captain," I replied, "that isn't a cause
for alarm, because the air tanks are full."</p>

<p id="id03375">"True," Captain Nemo went on, "but they'll supply air for only two days.<br/>

Now then, we've been buried beneath the waters for thirty-six hours,<br/>

and the Nautilus's heavy atmosphere already needs renewing.<br/>

In another forty-eight hours, our reserve air will be used up."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03376">"Well then, captain, let's free ourselves within forty-eight hours!"</p>

<p id="id03377">"We'll try to at least, by cutting through one of these
walls surrounding us."</p>

<p id="id03378">"Which one?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id03379">"Borings will tell us that.  I'm going to ground the Nautilus
on the lower shelf, then my men will put on their diving suits
and attack the thinnest of these ice walls."</p>

<p id="id03380">"Can the panels in the lounge be left open?"</p>

<p id="id03381">"Without ill effect.  We're no longer in motion."</p>

<p id="id03382">Captain Nemo went out.  Hissing sounds soon told me that water
was being admitted into the ballast tanks.  The Nautilus slowly
settled and rested on the icy bottom at a depth of 350 meters,
the depth at which the lower shelf of ice lay submerged.</p>

<p id="id03383">"My friends," I said, "we're in a serious predicament, but I'm
counting on your courage and energy."</p>

<p id="id03384">"Sir," the Canadian replied, "this is no time to bore you with
my complaints.  I'm ready to do anything I can for the common good."</p>

<p id="id03385">"Excellent, Ned," I said, extending my hand to the Canadian.</p>

<p id="id03386">"I might add," he went on, "that I'm as handy with a pick as a harpoon.<br/>

If I can be helpful to the captain, he can use me any way he wants."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03387">"He won't turn down your assistance.  Come along, Ned."</p>

<p id="id03388">I led the Canadian to the room where the Nautilus's men were putting
on their diving suits.  I informed the captain of Ned's proposition,
which was promptly accepted.  The Canadian got into his
underwater costume and was ready as soon as his fellow workers.
Each of them carried on his back a Rouquayrol device that the air
tanks had supplied with a generous allowance of fresh oxygen.
A considerable but necessary drain on the Nautilus's reserves.
As for the Ruhmkorff lamps, they were unnecessary in the midst
of these brilliant waters saturated with our electric rays.</p>

<p id="id03389">After Ned was dressed, I reentered the lounge, whose windows had
been uncovered; stationed next to Conseil, I examined the strata
surrounding and supporting the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id03390">Some moments later, we saw a dozen crewmen set foot on the shelf
of ice, among them Ned Land, easily recognized by his tall figure.
Captain Nemo was with them.</p>

<p id="id03391">Before digging into the ice, the captain had to obtain borings,
to insure working in the best direction.  Long bores were driven into
the side walls; but after fifteen meters, the instruments were still
impeded by the thickness of those walls.  It was futile to attack
the ceiling since that surface was the Ice Bank itself, more than
400 meters high.  Captain Nemo then bored into the lower surface.
There we were separated from the sea by a ten-meter barrier.
That's how thick the iceberg was.  From this point on, it was an issue
of cutting out a piece equal in surface area to the Nautilus's waterline.
This meant detaching about 6,500 cubic meters, to dig a hole through
which the ship could descend below this tract of ice.</p>

<p id="id03392">Work began immediately and was carried on with tireless tenacity.
Instead of digging all around the Nautilus, which would have
entailed even greater difficulties, Captain Nemo had an immense
trench outlined on the ice, eight meters from our port quarter.
Then his men simultaneously staked it off at several points around
its circumference.  Soon their picks were vigorously attacking
this compact matter, and huge chunks were loosened from its mass.
These chunks weighed less than the water, and by an unusual
effect of specific gravity, each chunk took wing, as it were,
to the roof of the tunnel, which thickened above by as much as it
diminished below.  But this hardly mattered so long as the lower
surface kept growing thinner.</p>

<p id="id03393">After two hours of energetic work, Ned Land reentered, exhausted.
He and his companions were replaced by new workmen, including Conseil
and me.  The Nautilus's chief officer supervised us.</p>

<p id="id03394">The water struck me as unusually cold, but I warmed up promptly
while wielding my pick.  My movements were quite free, although they
were executed under a pressure of thirty atmospheres.</p>

<p id="id03395">After two hours of work, reentering to snatch some food and rest,
I found a noticeable difference between the clean elastic fluid
supplied me by the Rouquayrol device and the Nautilus's atmosphere,
which was already charged with carbon dioxide.  The air hadn't
been renewed in forty-eight hours, and its life-giving qualities
were considerably weakened.  Meanwhile, after twelve hours had
gone by, we had removed from the outlined surface area a slice
of ice only one meter thick, hence about 600 cubic meters.
Assuming the same work would be accomplished every twelve hours,
it would still take five nights and four days to see the undertaking
through to completion.</p>

<p id="id03396">"Five nights and four days!"  I told my companions.  "And we have
oxygen in the air tanks for only two days."</p>

<p id="id03397">"Without taking into account," Ned answered, "that once we're out
of this damned prison, we'll still be cooped up beneath the Ice Bank,
without any possible contact with the open air!"</p>

<p id="id03398">An apt remark.  For who could predict the minimum time we would need
to free ourselves?  Before the Nautilus could return to the surface
of the waves, couldn't we all die of asphyxiation?  Were this
ship and everyone on board doomed to perish in this tomb of ice?
It was a dreadful state of affairs.  But we faced it head-on,
each one of us determined to do his duty to the end.</p>

<p id="id03399">During the night, in line with my forecasts, a new one-meter
slice was removed from this immense socket.  But in the morning,
wearing my diving suit, I was crossing through the liquid mass
in a temperature of -6 degrees to -7 degrees centigrade, when I noted
that little by little the side walls were closing in on each other.
The liquid strata farthest from the trench, not warmed by the movements
of workmen and tools, were showing a tendency to solidify.
In the face of this imminent new danger, what would happen to our
chances for salvation, and how could we prevent this liquid medium
from solidifying, then cracking the Nautilus's hull like glass?</p>

<p id="id03400">I didn't tell my two companions about this new danger.<br/>

There was no point in dampening the energy they were putting<br/>

into our arduous rescue work.  But when I returned on board,<br/>

I mentioned this serious complication to Captain Nemo.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03401">"I know," he told me in that calm tone the most dreadful outlook
couldn't change.  "It's one more danger, but I don't know any way
of warding it off.  Our sole chance for salvation is to work faster
than the water solidifies.  We've got to get there first, that's all."</p>

<p id="id03402">Get there first!  By then I should have been used to this type of talk!</p>

<p id="id03403">For several hours that day, I wielded my pick doggedly.
The work kept me going.  Besides, working meant leaving the Nautilus,
which meant breathing the clean oxygen drawn from the air tanks
and supplied by our equipment, which meant leaving the thin,
foul air behind.</p>

<p id="id03404">Near evening one more meter had been dug from the trench.
When I returned on board, I was wellnigh asphyxiated by the carbon
dioxide saturating the air.  Oh, if only we had the chemical
methods that would enable us to drive out this noxious gas!
There was no lack of oxygen.  All this water contained a considerable
amount, and after it was decomposed by our powerful batteries,
this life-giving elastic fluid could have been restored to us.
I had thought it all out, but to no avail because the carbon dioxide
produced by our breathing permeated every part of the ship.
To absorb it, we would need to fill containers with potassium
hydroxide and shake them continually.  But this substance was missing
on board and nothing else could replace it.</p>

<p id="id03405">That evening Captain Nemo was forced to open the spigots of his air tanks
and shoot a few spouts of fresh oxygen through the Nautilus's interior.
Without this precaution we wouldn't have awakened the following morning.</p>

<p id="id03406">The next day, March 26, I returned to my miner's trade, working to
remove the fifth meter.  The Ice Bank's side walls and underbelly
had visibly thickened.  Obviously they would come together before
the Nautilus could break free.  For an instant I was gripped by despair.
My pick nearly slipped from my hands.  What was the point of this
digging if I was to die smothered and crushed by this water turning
to stone, a torture undreamed of by even the wildest savages!
I felt like I was lying in the jaws of a fearsome monster,
jaws irresistibly closing.</p>

<p id="id03407">Supervising our work, working himself, Captain Nemo passed near me
just then.  I touched him with my hand and pointed to the walls
of our prison.  The starboard wall had moved forward to a point
less than four meters from the Nautilus's hull.</p>

<p id="id03408">The captain understood and gave me a signal to follow him.
We returned on board.  My diving suit removed, I went with him
to the lounge.</p>

<p id="id03409">"Professor Aronnax," he told me, "this calls for heroic measures,
or we'll be sealed up in this solidified water as if it were cement."</p>

<p id="id03410">"Yes!"  I said.  "But what can we do?"</p>

<p id="id03411">"Oh," he exclaimed, "if only my Nautilus were strong enough to stand
that much pressure without being crushed!"</p>

<p id="id03412">"Well?"  I asked, not catching the captain's meaning.</p>

<p id="id03413">"Don't you understand," he went on, "that the congealing of this
water could come to our rescue?  Don't you see that by solidifying,
it could burst these tracts of ice imprisoning us, just as its freezing
can burst the hardest stones?  Aren't you aware that this force could
be the instrument of our salvation rather than our destruction?"</p>

<p id="id03414">"Yes, captain, maybe so.  But whatever resistance to crushing
the Nautilus may have, it still couldn't stand such dreadful pressures,
and it would be squashed as flat as a piece of sheet iron."</p>

<p id="id03415">"I know it, sir.  So we can't rely on nature to rescue us,
only our own efforts.  We must counteract this solidification.
We must hold it in check.  Not only are the side walls closing in,
but there aren't ten feet of water ahead or astern of the Nautilus.
All around us, this freeze is gaining fast."</p>

<p id="id03416">"How long," I asked, "will the oxygen in the air tanks enable us
to breathe on board?"</p>

<p id="id03417">The captain looked me straight in the eye.</p>

<p id="id03418">"After tomorrow," he said, "the air tanks will be empty!"</p>

<p id="id03419">I broke out in a cold sweat.  But why should I have been
startled by this reply?  On March 22 the Nautilus had dived
under the open waters at the pole.  It was now the 26th.
We had lived off the ship's stores for five days!
And all remaining breathable air had to be saved for the workmen.
Even today as I write these lines, my sensations are so intense
that an involuntary terror sweeps over me, and my lungs still seem
short of air!</p>

<p id="id03420">Meanwhile, motionless and silent, Captain Nemo stood lost in thought.<br/>

An idea visibly crossed his mind.  But he seemed to brush it aside.<br/>

He told himself no.  At last these words escaped his lips:<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03421">"Boiling water!" he muttered.</p>

<p id="id03422">"Boiling water?"  I exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id03423">"Yes, sir.  We're shut up in a relatively confined area.
If the Nautilus's pumps continually injected streams of boiling
water into this space, wouldn't that raise its temperature and
delay its freezing?"</p>

<p id="id03424">"It's worth trying!"  I said resolutely.</p>

<p id="id03425">"So let's try it, professor."</p>

<p id="id03426">By then the thermometer gave -7 degrees centigrade outside.
Captain Nemo led me to the galley where a huge distilling
mechanism was at work, supplying drinking water via evaporation.
The mechanism was loaded with water, and the full electric
heat of our batteries was thrown into coils awash in liquid.
In a few minutes the water reached 100 degrees centigrade.
It was sent to the pumps while new water replaced it in the process.
The heat generated by our batteries was so intense that after simply
going through the mechanism, water drawn cold from the sea arrived
boiling hot at the body of the pump.</p>

<p id="id03427">The steaming water was injected into the icy water outside,
and after three hours had passed, the thermometer gave the exterior
temperature as -6 degrees centigrade.  That was one degree gained.
Two hours later the thermometer gave only -4 degrees.</p>

<p id="id03428">After I monitored the operation's progress, double-checking it
with many inspections, I told the captain, "It's working."</p>

<p id="id03429">"I think so," he answered me.  "We've escaped being crushed.<br/>

Now we have only asphyxiation to fear."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03430">During the night the water temperature rose to -1 degrees centigrade.<br/>

The injections couldn't get it to go a single degree higher.<br/>

But since salt water freezes only at -2 degrees, I was finally<br/>

assured that there was no danger of it solidifying.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03431">By the next day, March 27, six meters of ice had been torn
from the socket.  Only four meters were left to be removed.
That still meant forty-eight hours of work.  The air couldn't
be renewed in the Nautilus's interior.  Accordingly, that day it
kept getting worse.</p>

<p id="id03432">An unbearable heaviness weighed me down.  Near three o'clock in
the afternoon, this agonizing sensation affected me to an intense degree.
Yawns dislocated my jaws.  My lungs were gasping in their quest
for that enkindling elastic fluid required for breathing,
now growing scarcer and scarcer.  My mind was in a daze.
I lay outstretched, strength gone, nearly unconscious.
My gallant Conseil felt the same symptoms, suffered the same sufferings,
yet never left my side.  He held my hand, he kept encouraging me,
and I even heard him mutter:</p>

<p id="id03433">"Oh, if only I didn't have to breathe, to leave more air for master!"</p>

<p id="id03434">It brought tears to my eyes to hear him say these words.</p>

<p id="id03435">Since conditions inside were universally unbearable, how eagerly,
how happily, we put on our diving suits to take our turns working!
Picks rang out on that bed of ice.  Arms grew weary, hands were
rubbed raw, but who cared about exhaustion, what difference were wounds?
Life-sustaining air reached our lungs!  We could breathe!
We could breathe!</p>

<p id="id03436">And yet nobody prolonged his underwater work beyond the time
allotted him.  His shift over, each man surrendered to a gasping
companion the air tank that would revive him.  Captain Nemo set
the example and was foremost in submitting to this strict discipline.
When his time was up, he yielded his equipment to another and reentered
the foul air on board, always calm, unflinching, and uncomplaining.</p>

<p id="id03437">That day the usual work was accomplished with even greater energy.
Over the whole surface area, only two meters were left to be removed.
Only two meters separated us from the open sea.  But the ship's air
tanks were nearly empty.  The little air that remained had to be
saved for the workmen.  Not an atom for the Nautilus!</p>

<p id="id03438">When I returned on board, I felt half suffocated.  What a night!
I'm unable to depict it.  Such sufferings are indescribable.
The next day I was short-winded. Headaches and staggering fits of
dizziness made me reel like a drunk.  My companions were experiencing
the same symptoms.  Some crewmen were at their last gasp.</p>

<p id="id03439">That day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo concluded
that picks and mattocks were too slow to deal with the ice layer still
separating us from open water—and he decided to crush this layer.
The man had kept his energy and composure.  He had subdued physical
pain with moral strength.  He could still think, plan, and act.</p>

<p id="id03440">At his orders the craft was eased off, in other words, it was
raised from its icy bed by a change in its specific gravity.
When it was afloat, the crew towed it, leading it right above
the immense trench outlined to match the ship's waterline.
Next the ballast tanks filled with water, the boat sank, and was
fitted into its socket.</p>

<p id="id03441">Just then the whole crew returned on board, and the double outside
door was closed.  By this point the Nautilus was resting on a bed
of ice only one meter thick and drilled by bores in a thousand places.</p>

<p id="id03442">The stopcocks of the ballast tanks were then opened wide, and 100
cubic meters of water rushed in, increasing the Nautilus's weight
by 100,000 kilograms.</p>

<p id="id03443">We waited, we listened, we forgot our sufferings, we hoped once more.<br/>

We had staked our salvation on this one last gamble.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03444">Despite the buzzing in my head, I soon could hear vibrations under the
Nautilus's hull.  We tilted.  The ice cracked with an odd ripping sound,
like paper tearing, and the Nautilus began settling downward.</p>

<p id="id03445">"We're going through!"  Conseil muttered in my ear.</p>

<p id="id03446">I couldn't answer him.  I clutched his hand.  I squeezed it
in an involuntary convulsion.</p>

<p id="id03447">All at once, carried away by its frightful excess load,
the Nautilus sank into the waters like a cannonball, in other words,
dropping as if in a vacuum!</p>

<p id="id03448">Our full electric power was then put on the pumps,
which instantly began to expel water from the ballast tanks.
After a few minutes we had checked our fall.  The pressure gauge
soon indicated an ascending movement.  Brought to full speed,
the propeller made the sheet-iron hull tremble down to its rivets,
and we sped northward.</p>

<p id="id03449">But how long would it take to navigate under the Ice Bank to
the open sea?  Another day?  I would be dead first!</p>

<p id="id03450">Half lying on a couch in the library, I was suffocating.<br/>

My face was purple, my lips blue, my faculties in abeyance.<br/>

I could no longer see or hear.  I had lost all sense of time.<br/>

My muscles had no power to contract.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03451">I'm unable to estimate the hours that passed in this way.
But I was aware that my death throes had begun.  I realized that I
was about to die . . .</p>

<p id="id03452">Suddenly I regained consciousness.  A few whiffs of air had
entered my lungs.  Had we risen to the surface of the waves?
Had we cleared the Ice Bank?</p>

<p id="id03453">No!  Ned and Conseil, my two gallant friends, were sacrificing themselves
to save me.  A few atoms of air were still left in the depths
of one Rouquayrol device.  Instead of breathing it themselves,
they had saved it for me, and while they were suffocating, they poured
life into me drop by drop!  I tried to push the device away.
They held my hands, and for a few moments I could breathe luxuriously.</p>

<p id="id03454">My eyes flew toward the clock.  It was eleven in the morning.
It had to be March 28.  The Nautilus was traveling at the frightful
speed of forty miles per hour.  It was writhing in the waters.</p>

<p id="id03455">Where was Captain Nemo?  Had he perished?  Had his companions
died with him?</p>

<p id="id03456">Just then the pressure gauge indicated we were no more than twenty
feet from the surface.  Separating us from the open air was a mere
tract of ice.  Could we break through it?</p>

<p id="id03457">Perhaps!  In any event the Nautilus was going to try.  In fact,
I could feel it assuming an oblique position, lowering its stern
and raising its spur.  The admission of additional water was enough
to shift its balance.  Then, driven by its powerful propeller,
it attacked this ice field from below like a fearsome battering ram.
It split the barrier little by little, backing up, then putting
on full speed against the punctured tract of ice; and finally,
carried away by its supreme momentum, it lunged through and onto
this frozen surface, crushing the ice beneath its weight.</p>

<p id="id03458">The hatches were opened—or torn off, if you prefer—and waves
of clean air were admitted into every part of the Nautilus.</p>

<h1 id="id03459" style="margin-top: 9em">CHAPTER 17</h1>

<p id="id03460">From Cape Horn to the Amazon</p>

<p id="id03461" style="margin-top: 2em">HOW I GOT ONTO the platform I'm unable to say.
Perhaps the Canadian transferred me there.  But I could breathe,
I could inhale the life-giving sea air.  Next to me my two
companions were getting tipsy on the fresh oxygen particles.
Poor souls who have suffered from long starvation mustn't pounce
heedlessly on the first food given them.  We, on the other hand,
didn't have to practice such moderation:  we could suck the atoms
from the air by the lungful, and it was the breeze, the breeze itself,
that poured into us this luxurious intoxication!</p>

<p id="id03462">"Ahhh!"  Conseil was putting in.  "What fine oxygen!  Let master
have no fears about breathing.  There's enough for everyone."</p>

<p id="id03463">As for Ned Land, he didn't say a word, but his wide-open jaws
would have scared off a shark.  And what powerful inhalations!
The Canadian "drew" like a furnace going full blast.</p>

<p id="id03464">Our strength returned promptly, and when I looked around,
I saw that we were alone on the platform.  No crewmen.
Not even Captain Nemo.  Those strange seamen on the Nautilus
were content with the oxygen circulating inside.  Not one of them
had come up to enjoy the open air.</p>

<p id="id03465">The first words I pronounced were words of appreciation
and gratitude to my two companions.  Ned and Conseil had kept
me alive during the final hours of our long death throes.
But no expression of thanks could repay them fully for such devotion.</p>

<p id="id03466">"Good lord, professor," Ned Land answered me, "don't mention it!<br/>

What did we do that's so praiseworthy?  Not a thing.  It was a<br/>

question of simple arithmetic.  Your life is worth more than ours.<br/>

So we had to save it."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03467">"No, Ned," I replied, "it isn't worth more.  Nobody could be better
than a kind and generous man like yourself!"</p>

<p id="id03468">"All right, all right!" the Canadian repeated in embarrassment.</p>

<p id="id03469">"And you, my gallant Conseil, you suffered a great deal."</p>

<p id="id03470">"Not too much, to be candid with master.  I was lacking a few
throatfuls of air, but I would have gotten by.  Besides, when I saw
master fainting, it left me without the slightest desire to breathe.
It took my breath away, in a manner of . . ."</p>

<p id="id03471">Confounded by this lapse into banality, Conseil left his sentence hanging.</p>

<p id="id03472">"My friends," I replied, very moved, "we're bound to each other forever,
and I'm deeply indebted to you—"</p>

<p id="id03473">"Which I'll take advantage of," the Canadian shot back.</p>

<p id="id03474">"Eh?"  Conseil put in.</p>

<p id="id03475">"Yes," Ned Land went on.  "You can repay your debt by coming with me
when I leave this infernal Nautilus."</p>

<p id="id03476">"By the way," Conseil said, "are we going in a favorable direction?"</p>

<p id="id03477">"Yes," I replied, "because we're going in the direction of the sun,
and here the sun is due north."</p>

<p id="id03478">"Sure," Ned Land went on, "but it remains to be seen whether we'll
make for the Atlantic or the Pacific, in other words, whether we'll
end up in well-traveled or deserted seas."</p>

<p id="id03479">I had no reply to this, and I feared that Captain Nemo wouldn't
take us homeward but rather into that huge ocean washing the shores
of both Asia and America.  In this way he would complete his underwater
tour of the world, going back to those seas where the Nautilus
enjoyed the greatest freedom.  But if we returned to the Pacific,
far from every populated shore, what would happen to Ned Land's plans?</p>

<p id="id03480">We would soon settle this important point.  The Nautilus
traveled swiftly.  Soon we had cleared the Antarctic Circle
plus the promontory of Cape Horn.  We were abreast of the tip
of South America by March 31 at seven o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p id="id03481">By then all our past sufferings were forgotten.  The memory
of that imprisonment under the ice faded from our minds.
We had thoughts only of the future.  Captain Nemo no longer appeared,
neither in the lounge nor on the platform.  The positions reported
each day on the world map were put there by the chief officer,
and they enabled me to determine the Nautilus's exact heading.
Now then, that evening it became obvious, much to my satisfaction,
that we were returning north by the Atlantic route.</p>

<p id="id03482">I shared the results of my observations with the Canadian and Conseil.</p>

<p id="id03483">"That's good news," the Canadian replied, "but where's
the Nautilus going?"</p>

<p id="id03484">"I'm unable to say, Ned."</p>

<p id="id03485">"After the South Pole, does our captain want to tackle the North Pole,
then go back to the Pacific by the notorious Northwest Passage?"</p>

<p id="id03486">"I wouldn't double dare him," Conseil replied.</p>

<p id="id03487">"Oh well," the Canadian said, "we'll give him the slip long before then."</p>

<p id="id03488">"In any event," Conseil added, "he's a superman, that Captain Nemo,
and we'll never regret having known him."</p>

<p id="id03489">"Especially once we've left him," Ned Land shot back.</p>

<p id="id03490">The next day, April 1, when the Nautilus rose to the surface of
the waves a few minutes before noon, we raised land to the west.
It was Tierra del Fuego, the Land of Fire, a name given it
by early navigators after they saw numerous curls of smoke rising
from the natives' huts.  This Land of Fire forms a huge cluster
of islands over thirty leagues long and eighty leagues wide,
extending between latitude 53 degrees and 56 degrees south,
and between longitude 67 degrees 50' and 77 degrees 15' west.
Its coastline looked flat, but high mountains rose in the distance.
I even thought I glimpsed Mt.  Sarmiento, whose elevation is 2,070
meters above sea level:  a pyramid-shaped block of shale with a
very sharp summit, which, depending on whether it's clear or veiled
in vapor, "predicts fair weather or foul," as Ned Land told me.</p>

<p id="id03491">"A first-class barometer, my friend."</p>

<p id="id03492">"Yes, sir, a natural barometer that didn't let me down when I
navigated the narrows of the Strait of Magellan."</p>

<p id="id03493">Just then its peak appeared before us, standing out distinctly
against the background of the skies.  This forecast fair weather.
And so it proved.</p>

<p id="id03494">Going back under the waters, the Nautilus drew near the coast,
cruising along it for only a few miles.  Through the lounge
windows I could see long creepers and gigantic fucus plants,
bulb-bearing seaweed of which the open sea at the pole had revealed
a few specimens; with their smooth, viscous filaments, they measured
as much as 300 meters long; genuine cables more than an inch thick
and very tough, they're often used as mooring lines for ships.
Another weed, known by the name velp and boasting four-foot leaves,
was crammed into the coral concretions and carpeted the ocean floor.
It served as both nest and nourishment for myriads of crustaceans
and mollusks, for crabs and cuttlefish.  Here seals and otters could
indulge in a sumptuous meal, mixing meat from fish with vegetables
from the sea, like the English with their Irish stews.</p>

<p id="id03495">The Nautilus passed over these lush, luxuriant depths with
tremendous speed.  Near evening it approached the Falkland Islands,
whose rugged summits I recognized the next day.  The sea was of
moderate depth.  So not without good reason, I assumed that these
two islands, plus the many islets surrounding them, used to be part
of the Magellan coastline.  The Falkland Islands were probably
discovered by the famous navigator John Davis, who gave them the name
Davis Southern Islands.  Later Sir Richard Hawkins called them
the Maidenland, after the Blessed Virgin.  Subsequently, at the beginning
of the 18th century, they were named the Malouines by fishermen
from Saint-Malo in Brittany, then finally dubbed the Falklands
by the English, to whom they belong today.</p>

<p id="id03496">In these waterways our nets brought up fine samples of algae,
in particular certain fucus plants whose roots were laden with
the world's best mussels.  Geese and duck alighted by the dozens
on the platform and soon took their places in the ship's pantry.
As for fish, I specifically observed some bony fish belonging
to the goby genus, especially some gudgeon two decimeters long,
sprinkled with whitish and yellow spots.</p>

<p id="id03497">I likewise marveled at the numerous medusas, including the most beautiful
of their breed, the compass jellyfish, unique to the Falkland seas.
Some of these jellyfish were shaped like very smooth,
semispheric parasols with russet stripes and fringes of twelve
neat festoons.  Others looked like upside-down baskets from
which wide leaves and long red twigs were gracefully trailing.
They swam with quiverings of their four leaflike arms,
letting the opulent tresses of their tentacles dangle in the drift.
I wanted to preserve a few specimens of these delicate zoophytes,
but they were merely clouds, shadows, illusions, melting and evaporating
outside their native element.</p>

<p id="id03498">When the last tips of the Falkland Islands had disappeared below
the horizon, the Nautilus submerged to a depth between twenty
and twenty-five meters and went along the South American coast.
Captain Nemo didn't put in an appearance.</p>

<p id="id03499">We didn't leave these Patagonian waterways until April 3,
sometimes cruising under the ocean, sometimes on its surface.
The Nautilus passed the wide estuary formed by the mouth of the Rio
de la Plata, and on April 4 we lay abreast of Uruguay, albeit fifty
miles out.  Keeping to its northerly heading, it followed the long
windings of South America.  By then we had fared 16,000 leagues
since coming on board in the seas of Japan.</p>

<p id="id03500">Near eleven o'clock in the morning, we cut the Tropic of Capricorn
on the 37th meridian, passing well out from Cape Frio.  Much to
Ned Land's displeasure, Captain Nemo had no liking for the neighborhood
of Brazil's populous shores, because he shot by with dizzying speed.
Not even the swiftest fish or birds could keep up with us, and the
natural curiosities in these seas completely eluded our observation.</p>

<p id="id03501">This speed was maintained for several days, and on the evening
of April 9, we raised South America's easternmost tip,
Cape São Roque.  But then the Nautilus veered away again and went
looking for the lowest depths of an underwater valley gouged between
this cape and Sierra Leone on the coast of Africa.  Abreast of
the West Indies, this valley forks into two arms, and to
the north it ends in an enormous depression 9,000 meters deep.
From this locality to the Lesser Antilles, the ocean's geologic
profile features a steeply cut cliff six kilometers high, and abreast
of the Cape Verde Islands, there's another wall just as imposing;
together these two barricades confine the whole submerged continent
of Atlantis.  The floor of this immense valley is made picturesque
by mountains that furnish these underwater depths with scenic views.
This description is based mostly on certain hand-drawn charts kept
in the Nautilus's library, charts obviously rendered by Captain Nemo
himself from his own personal observations.</p>

<p id="id03502">For two days we visited these deep and deserted waters by means
of our slanting fins.  The Nautilus would do long, diagonal dives
that took us to every level.  But on April 11 it rose suddenly,
and the shore reappeared at the mouth of the Amazon River,
a huge estuary whose outflow is so considerable, it desalts the sea
over an area of several leagues.</p>

<p id="id03503">We cut the Equator.  Twenty miles to the west lay Guiana, French
territory where we could easily have taken refuge.
But the wind was blowing a strong gust, and the furious
billows would not allow us to face them in a mere skiff.
No doubt Ned Land understood this because he said nothing to me.
For my part, I made no allusion to his escape plans because I didn't
want to push him into an attempt that was certain to misfire.</p>

<p id="id03504">I was readily compensated for this delay by fascinating research.
During those two days of April 11-12, the Nautilus didn't leave
the surface of the sea, and its trawl brought up a simply miraculous
catch of zoophytes, fish, and reptiles.</p>

<p id="id03505">Some zoophytes were dredged up by the chain of our trawl.  Most were
lovely sea anemone belonging to the family Actinidia, including among
other species, the Phyctalis protexta, native to this part of the ocean:
a small cylindrical trunk adorned with vertical lines, mottled with
red spots, and crowned by a wondrous blossoming of tentacles.
As for mollusks, they consisted of exhibits I had already observed:
turret snails, olive shells of the "tent olive" species with neatly
intersecting lines and russet spots standing out sharply against
a flesh-colored background, fanciful spider conchs that looked
like petrified scorpions, transparent glass snails, argonauts,
some highly edible cuttlefish, and certain species of squid
that the naturalists of antiquity classified with the flying fish,
which are used chiefly as bait for catching cod.</p>

<p id="id03506">As for the fish in these waterways, I noted various species that I
hadn't yet had the opportunity to study.  Among cartilaginous fish:
some brook lamprey, a type of eel fifteen inches long, head greenish,
fins violet, back bluish gray, belly a silvery brown strewn with
bright spots, iris of the eye encircled in gold, unusual animals
that the Amazon's current must have swept out to sea because their
natural habitat is fresh water; sting rays, the snout pointed,
the tail long, slender, and armed with an extensive jagged sting;
small one-meter sharks with gray and whitish hides, their teeth
arranged in several backward-curving rows, fish commonly known
by the name carpet shark; batfish, a sort of reddish isosceles
triangle half a meter long, whose pectoral fins are attached
by fleshy extensions that make these fish look like bats,
although an appendage made of horn, located near the nostrils,
earns them the nickname of sea unicorns; lastly, a couple species
of triggerfish, the cucuyo whose stippled flanks glitter with a
sparkling gold color, and the bright purple leatherjacket whose
hues glisten like a pigeon's throat.</p>

<p id="id03507">I'll finish up this catalog, a little dry but quite accurate,
with the series of bony fish I observed:  eels belonging to the genus
Apteronotus whose snow-white snout is very blunt, the body painted
a handsome black and armed with a very long, slender, fleshy whip;
long sardines from the genus Odontognathus, like three-decimeter pike,
shining with a bright silver glow; Guaranian mackerel furnished with two
anal fins; black-tinted rudderfish that you catch by using torches,
fish measuring two meters and boasting white, firm, plump meat that,
when fresh, tastes like eel, when dried, like smoked salmon;
semired wrasse sporting scales only at the bases of their dorsal
and anal fins; grunts on which gold and silver mingle their luster
with that of ruby and topaz; yellow-tailed gilthead whose flesh
is extremely dainty and whose phosphorescent properties give
them away in the midst of the waters; porgies tinted orange,
with slender tongues; croakers with gold caudal fins; black surgeonfish;
four-eyed fish from Surinam, etc.</p>

<p id="id03508">This "et cetera" won't keep me from mentioning one more fish
that Conseil, with good reason, will long remember.</p>

<p id="id03509">One of our nets had hauled up a type of very flat ray that weighed
some twenty kilograms; with its tail cut off, it would have formed
a perfect disk.  It was white underneath and reddish on top, with big
round spots of deep blue encircled in black, its hide quite smooth
and ending in a double-lobed fin.  Laid out on the platform, it kept
struggling with convulsive movements, trying to turn over, making such
efforts that its final lunge was about to flip it into the sea.
But Conseil, being very possessive of his fish, rushed at it,
and before I could stop him, he seized it with both hands.</p>

<p id="id03510">Instantly there he was, thrown on his back, legs in the air,
his body half paralyzed, and yelling:</p>

<p id="id03511">"Oh, sir, sir!  Will you help me!"</p>

<p id="id03512">For once in his life, the poor lad didn't address me "in
the third person."</p>

<p id="id03513">The Canadian and I sat him up; we massaged his contracted arms,
and when he regained his five senses, that eternal classifier
mumbled in a broken voice:</p>

<p id="id03514">"Class of cartilaginous fish, order Chondropterygia with fixed gills,
suborder Selacia, family Rajiiforma, genus electric ray."</p>

<p id="id03515">"Yes, my friend," I answered, "it was an electric ray that put you
in this deplorable state."</p>

<p id="id03516">"Oh, master can trust me on this," Conseil shot back.<br/>

"I'll be revenged on that animal!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03517">"How?"</p>

<p id="id03518">"I'll eat it."</p>

<p id="id03519">Which he did that same evening, but strictly as retaliation.<br/>

Because, frankly, it tasted like leather.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id03520">Poor Conseil had assaulted an electric ray of the most dangerous species,
the cumana.  Living in a conducting medium such as water, this bizarre
animal can electrocute other fish from several meters away,
so great is the power of its electric organ, an organ whose two chief
surfaces measure at least twenty-seven square feet.</p>

<p id="id03521">During the course of the next day, April 12, the Nautilus drew near the
coast of Dutch Guiana, by the mouth of the Maroni River.  There several
groups of sea cows were living in family units.  These were manatees,
which belong to the order Sirenia, like the dugong and Steller's sea cow.
Harmless and unaggressive, these fine animals were six to seven
meters long and must have weighed at least 4,000 kilograms each.
I told Ned Land and Conseil that farseeing nature had given these
mammals a major role to play.  In essence, manatees, like seals,
are designed to graze the underwater prairies, destroying the clusters
of weeds that obstruct the mouths of tropical rivers.</p>

<p id="id03522">"And do you know," I added, "what happened since man has
almost completely wiped out these beneficial races?
Rotting weeds have poisoned the air, and this poisoned air causes
the yellow fever that devastates these wonderful countries.
This toxic vegetation has increased beneath the seas of the Torrid Zone,
so the disease spreads unchecked from the mouth of the Rio de la
Plata to Florida!"</p>

<p id="id03523">And if Professor Toussenel is correct, this plague is nothing
compared to the scourge that will strike our descendants
once the seas are depopulated of whales and seals.  By then,
crowded with jellyfish, squid, and other devilfish, the oceans
will have become huge centers of infection, because their waves
will no longer possess "these huge stomachs that God has entrusted
with scouring the surface of the sea."</p>

<p id="id03524">Meanwhile, without scorning these theories, the Nautilus's crew captured
half a dozen manatees.  In essence, it was an issue of stocking
the larder with excellent red meat, even better than beef or veal.
Their hunting was not a fascinating sport.  The manatees let
themselves be struck down without offering any resistance.
Several thousand kilos of meat were hauled below, to be dried and stored.</p>

<p id="id03525">The same day an odd fishing practice further increased
the Nautilus's stores, so full of game were these seas.
Our trawl brought up in its meshes a number of fish whose heads were
topped by little oval slabs with fleshy edges.  These were suckerfish
from the third family of the subbrachian Malacopterygia.  These flat
disks on their heads consist of crosswise plates of movable cartilage,
between which the animals can create a vacuum, enabling them to stick
to objects like suction cups.</p>

<p id="id03526">The remoras I had observed in the Mediterranean were related to
this species.  But the creature at issue here was an Echeneis osteochara,
unique to this sea.  Right after catching them, our seamen dropped
them in buckets of water.</p>

<p id="id03527">Its fishing finished, the Nautilus drew nearer to the coast.
In this locality a number of sea turtles were sleeping on the surface
of the waves.  It would have been difficult to capture these
valuable reptiles, because they wake up at the slightest sound,
and their solid carapaces are harpoon-proof. But our suckerfish would
effect their capture with extraordinary certainty and precision.
In truth, this animal is a living fishhook, promising wealth
and happiness to the greenest fisherman in the business.</p>

<p id="id03528">The Nautilus's men attached to each fish's tail a ring that was big
enough not to hamper its movements, and to this ring a long rope
whose other end was moored on board.</p>

<p id="id03529">Thrown into the sea, the suckerfish immediately began to play their roles,
going and fastening themselves onto the breastplates of the turtles.
Their tenacity was so great, they would rip apart rather than let go.
They were hauled in, still sticking to the turtles that came
aboard with them.</p>

<p id="id03530">In this way we caught several loggerheads, reptiles a meter
wide and weighing 200 kilos.  They're extremely valuable
because of their carapaces, which are covered with big slabs
of horn, thin, brown, transparent, with white and yellow markings.
Besides, they were excellent from an edible viewpoint, with an
exquisite flavor comparable to the green turtle.</p>

<p id="id03531">This fishing ended our stay in the waterways of the Amazon,
and that evening the Nautilus took to the high seas once more.</p>
