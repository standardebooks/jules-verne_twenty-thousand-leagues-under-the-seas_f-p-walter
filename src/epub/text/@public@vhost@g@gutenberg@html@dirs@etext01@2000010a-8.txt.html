<p id="id01827" style="margin-top: 3em">The Coral Realm</p>

<p id="id01828" style="margin-top: 3em">THE NEXT DAY I woke up with my head unusually clear.  Much to
my surprise, I was in my stateroom.  No doubt my companions had been
put back in their cabin without noticing it any more than I had.
Like me, they would have no idea what took place during the night, and to
unravel this mystery I could count only on some future happenstance.</p>

<p id="id01829">I then considered leaving my stateroom.  Was I free or still a prisoner?
Perfectly free.  I opened my door, headed down the gangways,
and climbed the central companionway.  Hatches that had been closed
the day before were now open.  I arrived on the platform.</p>

<p id="id01830">Ned Land and Conseil were there waiting for me.  I questioned them.
They knew nothing.  Lost in a heavy sleep of which they had no memory,
they were quite startled to be back in their cabin.</p>

<p id="id01831">As for the Nautilus, it seemed as tranquil and mysterious as ever.<br/>

It was cruising on the surface of the waves at a moderate speed.<br/>

Nothing seemed to have changed on board.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01832">Ned Land observed the sea with his penetrating eyes.  It was deserted.<br/>

The Canadian sighted nothing new on the horizon, neither sail nor shore.<br/>

A breeze was blowing noisily from the west, and disheveled by the wind,<br/>

long billows made the submersible roll very noticeably.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01833">After renewing its air, the Nautilus stayed at an average depth
of fifteen meters, enabling it to return quickly to the surface
of the waves.  And, contrary to custom, it executed such a maneuver
several times during that day of January 19.  The chief officer
would then climb onto the platform, and his usual phrase would ring
through the ship's interior.</p>

<p id="id01834">As for Captain Nemo, he didn't appear.  Of the other men on board,
I saw only my emotionless steward, who served me with his
usual mute efficiency.</p>

<p id="id01835">Near two o'clock I was busy organizing my notes in the lounge,
when the captain opened the door and appeared.  I bowed to him.
He gave me an almost imperceptible bow in return, without saying a word
to me.  I resumed my work, hoping he might give me some explanation
of the previous afternoon's events.  He did nothing of the sort.
I stared at him.  His face looked exhausted; his reddened eyes
hadn't been refreshed by sleep; his facial features expressed
profound sadness, real chagrin.  He walked up and down,
sat and stood, picked up a book at random, discarded it immediately,
consulted his instruments without taking his customary notes,
and seemed unable to rest easy for an instant.</p>

<p id="id01836">Finally he came over to me and said:</p>

<p id="id01837">"Are you a physician, Professor Aronnax?"</p>

<p id="id01838">This inquiry was so unexpected that I stared at him a good
while without replying.</p>

<p id="id01839">"Are you a physician?" he repeated.  "Several of your
scientific colleagues took their degrees in medicine,
such as Gratiolet, Moquin-Tandon, and others."</p>

<p id="id01840">"That's right," I said, "I am a doctor, I used to be on call
at the hospitals.  I was in practice for several years before
joining the museum."</p>

<p id="id01841">"Excellent, sir."</p>

<p id="id01842">My reply obviously pleased Captain Nemo.  But not knowing what
he was driving at, I waited for further questions, ready to reply
as circumstances dictated.</p>

<p id="id01843">"Professor Aronnax," the captain said to me, "would you consent
to give your medical attentions to one of my men?"</p>

<p id="id01844">"Someone is sick?"</p>

<p id="id01845">"Yes."</p>

<p id="id01846">"I'm ready to go with you."</p>

<p id="id01847">"Come."</p>

<p id="id01848">I admit that my heart was pounding.  Lord knows why, but I saw a definite
connection between this sick crewman and yesterday's happenings,
and the mystery of those events concerned me at least as much
as the man's sickness.</p>

<p id="id01849">Captain Nemo led me to the Nautilus's stern and invited me into
a cabin located next to the sailors' quarters.</p>

<p id="id01850">On a bed there lay a man some forty years old, with strongly
molded features, the very image of an Anglo-Saxon.</p>

<p id="id01851">I bent over him.  Not only was he sick, he was wounded.<br/>

Swathed in blood-soaked linen, his head was resting on a folded pillow.<br/>

I undid the linen bandages, while the wounded man gazed with great<br/>

staring eyes and let me proceed without making a single complaint.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01852">It was a horrible wound.  The cranium had been smashed open
by some blunt instrument, leaving the naked brains exposed,
and the cerebral matter had suffered deep abrasions.  Blood clots had
formed in this dissolving mass, taking on the color of wine dregs.
Both contusion and concussion of the brain had occurred.  The sick
man's breathing was labored, and muscle spasms quivered in his face.
Cerebral inflammation was complete and had brought on a paralysis
of movement and sensation.</p>

<p id="id01853">I took the wounded man's pulse.  It was intermittent.
The body's extremities were already growing cold, and I saw that death
was approaching without any possibility of my holding it in check.
After dressing the poor man's wound, I redid the linen bandages
around his head, and I turned to Captain Nemo.</p>

<p id="id01854">"How did he get this wound?"  I asked him.</p>

<p id="id01855">"That's not important," the captain replied evasively.
"The Nautilus suffered a collision that cracked one of the engine levers,
and it struck this man.  My chief officer was standing beside him.
This man leaped forward to intercept the blow.  A brother lays down his
life for his brother, a friend for his friend, what could be simpler?
That's the law for everyone on board the Nautilus.  But what's
your diagnosis of his condition?"</p>

<p id="id01856">I hesitated to speak my mind.</p>

<p id="id01857">"You may talk freely," the captain told me.  "This man
doesn't understand French."</p>

<p id="id01858">I took a last look at the wounded man, then I replied:</p>

<p id="id01859">"This man will be dead in two hours."</p>

<p id="id01860">"Nothing can save him?"</p>

<p id="id01861">"Nothing."</p>

<p id="id01862">Captain Nemo clenched his fists, and tears slid from his eyes,
which I had thought incapable of weeping.</p>

<p id="id01863">For a few moments more I observed the dying man, whose life was
ebbing little by little.  He grew still more pale under the electric
light that bathed his deathbed.  I looked at his intelligent head,
furrowed with premature wrinkles that misfortune, perhaps misery,
had etched long before.  I was hoping to detect the secret of his
life in the last words that might escape from his lips!</p>

<p id="id01864">"You may go, Professor Aronnax," Captain Nemo told me.</p>

<p id="id01865">I left the captain in the dying man's cabin and I repaired
to my stateroom, very moved by this scene.  All day long I was
aquiver with gruesome forebodings.  That night I slept poorly,
and between my fitful dreams, I thought I heard a distant moaning,
like a funeral dirge.  Was it a prayer for the dead, murmured in
that language I couldn't understand?</p>

<p id="id01866">The next morning I climbed on deck.  Captain Nemo was already there.<br/>

As soon as he saw me, he came over.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01867">"Professor," he said to me, "would it be convenient for you to make
an underwater excursion today?"</p>

<p id="id01868">"With my companions?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id01869">"If they're agreeable."</p>

<p id="id01870">"We're yours to command, captain."</p>

<p id="id01871">"Then kindly put on your diving suits."</p>

<p id="id01872">As for the dead or dying man, he hadn't come into the picture.  I rejoined<br/>

Ned Land and Conseil.  I informed them of Captain Nemo's proposition.<br/>

Conseil was eager to accept, and this time the Canadian proved<br/>

perfectly amenable to going with us.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01873">It was eight o'clock in the morning.  By 8:30 we were suited up for this
new stroll and equipped with our two devices for lighting and breathing.
The double door opened, and accompanied by Captain Nemo with a dozen
crewmen following, we set foot on the firm seafloor where the Nautilus
was resting, ten meters down.</p>

<p id="id01874">A gentle slope gravitated to an uneven bottom whose depth was
about fifteen fathoms.  This bottom was completely different
from the one I had visited during my first excursion under
the waters of the Pacific Ocean.  Here I saw no fine-grained sand,
no underwater prairies, not one open-sea forest.  I immediately recognized
the wondrous region in which Captain Nemo did the honors that day.
It was the coral realm.</p>

<p id="id01875">In the zoophyte branch, class Alcyonaria, one finds the order Gorgonaria,
which contains three groups:  sea fans, isidian polyps, and coral polyps.
It's in this last that precious coral belongs, an unusual substance that,
at different times, has been classified in the mineral, vegetable,
and animal kingdoms.  Medicine to the ancients, jewelry to the moderns,
it wasn't decisively placed in the animal kingdom until 1694,
by Peysonnel of Marseilles.</p>

<p id="id01876">A coral is a unit of tiny animals assembled over a polypary
that's brittle and stony in nature.  These polyps have a unique
generating mechanism that reproduces them via the budding process,
and they have an individual existence while also participating
in a communal life.  Hence they embody a sort of natural socialism.
I was familiar with the latest research on this bizarre zoophyte—
which turns to stone while taking on a tree form, as some naturalists
have very aptly observed—and nothing could have been more fascinating
to me than to visit one of these petrified forests that nature has
planted on the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p id="id01877">We turned on our Ruhmkorff devices and went along a coral shoal
in the process of forming, which, given time, will someday close
off this whole part of the Indian Ocean.  Our path was bordered
by hopelessly tangled bushes, formed from snarls of shrubs
all covered with little star-shaped, white-streaked flowers.
Only, contrary to plants on shore, these tree forms become attached
to rocks on the seafloor by heading from top to bottom.</p>

<p id="id01878">Our lights produced a thousand delightful effects while playing over
these brightly colored boughs.  I fancied I saw these cylindrical,
membrane-filled tubes trembling beneath the water's undulations.
I was tempted to gather their fresh petals, which were adorned with
delicate tentacles, some newly in bloom, others barely opened, while
nimble fish with fluttering fins brushed past them like flocks of birds.
But if my hands came near the moving flowers of these sensitive,
lively creatures, an alarm would instantly sound throughout the colony.
The white petals retracted into their red sheaths, the flowers vanished
before my eyes, and the bush changed into a chunk of stony nipples.</p>

<p id="id01879">Sheer chance had placed me in the presence of the most valuable
specimens of this zoophyte.  This coral was the equal of those fished
up from the Mediterranean off the Barbary Coast or the shores
of France and Italy.  With its bright colors, it lived up to those
poetic names of blood flower and blood foam that the industry
confers on its finest exhibits.  Coral sells for as much as 500
francs per kilogram, and in this locality the liquid strata hid
enough to make the fortunes of a whole host of coral fishermen.
This valuable substance often merges with other polyparies,
forming compact, hopelessly tangled units known as "macciota,"
and I noted some wonderful pink samples of this coral.</p>

<p id="id01880">But as the bushes shrank, the tree forms magnified.
Actual petrified thickets and long alcoves from some fantastic
school of architecture kept opening up before our steps.
Captain Nemo entered beneath a dark gallery whose gentle slope
took us to a depth of 100 meters.  The light from our glass coils
produced magical effects at times, lingering on the wrinkled roughness
of some natural arch, or some overhang suspended like a chandelier,
which our lamps flecked with fiery sparks.  Amid these shrubs
of precious coral, I observed other polyps no less unusual:
melita coral, rainbow coral with jointed outgrowths, then a few
tufts of genus Corallina, some green and others red, actually a type
of seaweed encrusted with limestone salts, which, after long disputes,
naturalists have finally placed in the vegetable kingdom.
But as one intellectual has remarked, "Here, perhaps, is the actual
point where life rises humbly out of slumbering stone, but without
breaking away from its crude starting point."</p>

<p id="id01881">Finally, after two hours of walking, we reached a depth of about
300 meters, in other words, the lowermost limit at which coral
can begin to form.  But here it was no longer some isolated bush
or a modest grove of low timber.  It was an immense forest,
huge mineral vegetation, enormous petrified trees linked by garlands
of elegant hydras from the genus Plumularia, those tropical
creepers of the sea, all decked out in shades and gleams.
We passed freely under their lofty boughs, lost up in the shadows
of the waves, while at our feet organ-pipe coral, stony coral,
star coral, fungus coral, and sea anemone from the genus Caryophylia
formed a carpet of flowers all strewn with dazzling gems.</p>

<p id="id01882">What an indescribable sight!  Oh, if only we could share our feelings!
Why were we imprisoned behind these masks of metal and glass!
Why were we forbidden to talk with each other!  At least let us
lead the lives of the fish that populate this liquid element,
or better yet, the lives of amphibians, which can spend long hours
either at sea or on shore, traveling through their double domain
as their whims dictate!</p>

<p id="id01883">Meanwhile Captain Nemo had called a halt.  My companions and I
stopped walking, and turning around, I saw the crewmen form
a semicircle around their leader.  Looking with greater care,
I observed that four of them were carrying on their shoulders
an object that was oblong in shape.</p>

<p id="id01884">At this locality we stood in the center of a huge clearing
surrounded by the tall tree forms of this underwater forest.
Our lamps cast a sort of brilliant twilight over the area,
making inordinately long shadows on the seafloor.  Past the boundaries
of the clearing, the darkness deepened again, relieved only by little
sparkles given off by the sharp crests of coral.</p>

<p id="id01885">Ned Land and Conseil stood next to me.  We stared, and it
dawned on me that I was about to witness a strange scene.
Observing the seafloor, I saw that it swelled at certain points from
low bulges that were encrusted with limestone deposits and arranged
with a symmetry that betrayed the hand of man.</p>

<p id="id01886">In the middle of the clearing, on a pedestal of roughly piled rocks,
there stood a cross of coral, extending long arms you would have
thought were made of petrified blood.</p>

<p id="id01887">At a signal from Captain Nemo, one of his men stepped forward and,
a few feet from this cross, detached a mattock from his belt
and began to dig a hole.</p>

<p id="id01888">I finally understood!  This clearing was a cemetery, this hole a grave,
that oblong object the body of the man who must have died during
the night!  Captain Nemo and his men had come to bury their companion
in this communal resting place on the inaccessible ocean floor!</p>

<p id="id01889">No!  My mind was reeling as never before!  Never had ideas of such impact
raced through my brain!  I didn't want to see what my eyes saw!</p>

<p id="id01890">Meanwhile the grave digging went slowly.  Fish fled here and
there as their retreat was disturbed.  I heard the pick ringing
on the limestone soil, its iron tip sometimes giving off sparks
when it hit a stray piece of flint on the sea bottom.  The hole
grew longer, wider, and soon was deep enough to receive the body.</p>

<p id="id01891">Then the pallbearers approached.  Wrapped in white fabric made from
filaments of the fan mussel, the body was lowered into its watery grave.
Captain Nemo, arms crossed over his chest, knelt in a posture
of prayer, as did all the friends of him who had loved them. . . .
My two companions and I bowed reverently.</p>

<p id="id01892">The grave was then covered over with the rubble dug from the seafloor,
and it formed a low mound.</p>

<p id="id01893">When this was done, Captain Nemo and his men stood up; then they
all approached the grave, sank again on bended knee, and extended
their hands in a sign of final farewell. . . .</p>

<p id="id01894">Then the funeral party went back up the path to the Nautilus,
returning beneath the arches of the forest, through the thickets,
along the coral bushes, going steadily higher.</p>

<p id="id01895">Finally the ship's rays appeared.  Their luminous trail guided us
to the Nautilus.  By one o'clock we had returned.</p>

<p id="id01896">After changing clothes, I climbed onto the platform, and in the grip
of dreadfully obsessive thoughts, I sat next to the beacon.</p>

<p id="id01897">Captain Nemo rejoined me.  I stood up and said to him:</p>

<p id="id01898">"So, as I predicted, that man died during the night?"</p>

<p id="id01899">"Yes, Professor Aronnax," Captain Nemo replied.</p>

<p id="id01900">"And now he rests beside his companions in that coral cemetery?"</p>

<p id="id01901">"Yes, forgotten by the world but not by us!  We dig the graves,
then entrust the polyps with sealing away our dead for eternity!"</p>

<p id="id01902">And with a sudden gesture, the captain hid his face in his clenched fists,
vainly trying to hold back a sob.  Then he added:</p>

<p id="id01903">"There lies our peaceful cemetery, hundreds of feet beneath
the surface of the waves!"</p>

<p id="id01904">"At least, captain, your dead can sleep serenely there, out of
the reach of sharks!"</p>

<p id="id01905">"Yes, sir," Captain Nemo replied solemnly, "of sharks and men!"</p>

<p id="id02005">______________________________________________________________</p>

<h1 id="id02006" style="margin-top: 7em">CHAPTER 1</h1>

<p id="id02007">The Indian Ocean</p>

<p id="id02008" style="margin-top: 2em">NOW WE BEGIN the second part of this voyage under the seas.
The first ended in that moving scene at the coral cemetery,
which left a profound impression on my mind.  And so Captain Nemo
would live out his life entirely in the heart of this immense sea,
and even his grave lay ready in its impenetrable depths.
There the last sleep of the Nautilus's occupants, friends bound together
in death as in life, would be disturbed by no monster of the deep!
"No man either!" the captain had added.</p>

<p id="id02009">Always that same fierce, implacable defiance of human society!</p>

<p id="id02010">As for me, I was no longer content with the hypotheses
that satisfied Conseil.  That fine lad persisted in seeing
the Nautilus's commander as merely one of those unappreciated
scientists who repay humanity's indifference with contempt.
For Conseil, the captain was still a misunderstood genius who,
tired of the world's deceptions, had been driven to take refuge in this
inaccessible environment where he was free to follow his instincts.
But to my mind, this hypothesis explained only one side of Captain Nemo.</p>

<p id="id02011">In fact, the mystery of that last afternoon when we were locked in
prison and put to sleep, the captain's violent precaution of snatching
from my grasp a spyglass poised to scour the horizon, and the fatal
wound given that man during some unexplained collision suffered
by the Nautilus, all led me down a plain trail.  No!  Captain Nemo
wasn't content simply to avoid humanity!  His fearsome submersible
served not only his quest for freedom, but also, perhaps, it was
used in lord-knows-what schemes of dreadful revenge.</p>

<p id="id02012">Right now, nothing is clear to me, I still glimpse only glimmers
in the dark, and I must limit my pen, as it were, to taking
dictation from events.</p>

<p id="id02013">But nothing binds us to Captain Nemo.  He believes that escaping from
the Nautilus is impossible.  We are not even constrained by our word
of honor.  No promises fetter us.  We're simply captives, prisoners
masquerading under the name "guests" for the sake of everyday courtesy.
Even so, Ned Land hasn't given up all hope of recovering his freedom.
He's sure to take advantage of the first chance that comes his way.
No doubt I will do likewise.  And yet I will feel some regret at making
off with the Nautilus's secrets, so generously unveiled for us by
Captain Nemo!  Because, ultimately, should we detest or admire this man?
Is he the persecutor or the persecuted?  And in all honesty,
before I leave him forever, I want to finish this underwater
tour of the world, whose first stages have been so magnificent.
I want to observe the full series of these wonders gathered under
the seas of our globe.  I want to see what no man has seen yet,
even if I must pay for this insatiable curiosity with my life!
What are my discoveries to date?  Nothing, relatively speaking—
since so far we've covered only 6,000 leagues across the Pacific!</p>

<p id="id02014">Nevertheless, I'm well aware that the Nautilus is drawing near
to populated shores, and if some chance for salvation becomes
available to us, it would be sheer cruelty to sacrifice my
companions to my passion for the unknown.  I must go with them,
perhaps even guide them.  But will this opportunity ever arise?
The human being, robbed of his free will, craves such an opportunity;
but the scientist, forever inquisitive, dreads it.</p>

<p id="id02015">That day, January 21, 1868, the chief officer went at noon to take
the sun's altitude.  I climbed onto the platform, lit a cigar,
and watched him at work.  It seemed obvious to me that this man didn't
understand French, because I made several remarks in a loud voice
that were bound to provoke him to some involuntary show of interest
had he understood them; but he remained mute and emotionless.</p>

<p id="id02016">While he took his sights with his sextant, one of the Nautilus's sailors—
that muscular man who had gone with us to Crespo Island during our first
underwater excursion—came up to clean the glass panes of the beacon.
I then examined the fittings of this mechanism, whose power was
increased a hundredfold by biconvex lenses that were designed
like those in a lighthouse and kept its rays productively focused.
This electric lamp was so constructed as to yield its maximum
illuminating power.  In essence, its light was generated in a vacuum,
insuring both its steadiness and intensity.  Such a vacuum also reduced
wear on the graphite points between which the luminous arc expanded.
This was an important savings for Captain Nemo, who couldn't
easily renew them.  But under these conditions, wear and tear
were almost nonexistent.</p>

<p id="id02017">When the Nautilus was ready to resume its underwater travels,
I went below again to the lounge.  The hatches closed once more,
and our course was set due west.</p>

<p id="id02018">We then plowed the waves of the Indian Ocean, vast liquid plains
with an area of 550,000,000 hectares, whose waters are so transparent
it makes you dizzy to lean over their surface.  There the Nautilus
generally drifted at a depth between 100 and 200 meters.
It behaved in this way for some days.  To anyone without my grand
passion for the sea, these hours would surely have seemed long
and monotonous; but my daily strolls on the platform where I was
revived by the life-giving ocean air, the sights in the rich waters
beyond the lounge windows, the books to be read in the library,
and the composition of my memoirs, took up all my time and left me
without a moment of weariness or boredom.</p>

<p id="id02019">All in all, we enjoyed a highly satisfactory state of health.
The diet on board agreed with us perfectly, and for my part,
I could easily have gone without those changes of pace that Ned Land,
in a spirit of protest, kept taxing his ingenuity to supply us.
What's more, in this constant temperature we didn't even have to
worry about catching colds.  Besides, the ship had a good stock of
the madrepore Dendrophylia, known in Provence by the name sea fennel,
and a poultice made from the dissolved flesh of its polyps will
furnish an excellent cough medicine.</p>

<p id="id02020">For some days we saw a large number of aquatic birds with webbed feet,
known as gulls or sea mews.  Some were skillfully slain, and when cooked
in a certain fashion, they make a very acceptable platter of water game.
Among the great wind riders—carried over long distances from every
shore and resting on the waves from their exhausting flights—
I spotted some magnificent albatross, birds belonging to the Longipennes
(long-winged) family, whose discordant calls sound like the braying
of an ass.  The Totipalmes (fully webbed) family was represented
by swift frigate birds, nimbly catching fish at the surface,
and by numerous tropic birds of the genus Phaeton, among others
the red-tailed tropic bird, the size of a pigeon, its white plumage
shaded with pink tints that contrasted with its dark-hued wings.</p>

<p id="id02021">The Nautilus's nets hauled up several types of sea turtle from
the hawksbill genus with arching backs whose scales are highly prized.
Diving easily, these reptiles can remain a good while underwater
by closing the fleshy valves located at the external openings of their
nasal passages.  When they were captured, some hawksbills were still
asleep inside their carapaces, a refuge from other marine animals.
The flesh of these turtles was nothing memorable, but their eggs
made an excellent feast.</p>

<p id="id02022">As for fish, they always filled us with wonderment when, staring through
the open panels, we could unveil the secrets of their aquatic lives.
I noted several species I hadn't previously been able to observe.</p>

<p id="id02023">I'll mention chiefly some trunkfish unique to the Red Sea, the sea
of the East Indies, and that part of the ocean washing the coasts
of equinoctial America.  Like turtles, armadillos, sea urchins,
and crustaceans, these fish are protected by armor plate that's
neither chalky nor stony but actual bone.  Sometimes this armor takes
the shape of a solid triangle, sometimes that of a solid quadrangle.
Among the triangular type, I noticed some half a decimeter long,
with brown tails, yellow fins, and wholesome, exquisitely tasty flesh;
I even recommend that they be acclimatized to fresh water, a change,
incidentally, that a number of saltwater fish can make with ease.
I'll also mention some quadrangular trunkfish topped by four large
protuberances along the back; trunkfish sprinkled with white spots on
the underside of the body, which make good house pets like certain birds;
boxfish armed with stings formed by extensions of their bony crusts,
and whose odd grunting has earned them the nickname "sea pigs";
then some trunkfish known as dromedaries, with tough, leathery flesh
and big conical humps.</p>

<p id="id02024">From the daily notes kept by Mr. Conseil, I also retrieve
certain fish from the genus Tetradon unique to these seas:
southern puffers with red backs and white chests distinguished by
three lengthwise rows of filaments, and jugfish, seven inches long,
decked out in the brightest colors.  Then, as specimens of other genera,
blowfish resembling a dark brown egg, furrowed with white bands,
and lacking tails; globefish, genuine porcupines of the sea,
armed with stings and able to inflate themselves until they look
like a pin cushion bristling with needles; seahorses common to
every ocean; flying dragonfish with long snouts and highly distended
pectoral fins shaped like wings, which enable them, if not to fly,
at least to spring into the air; spatula-shaped paddlefish whose
tails are covered with many scaly rings; snipefish with long jaws,
excellent animals twenty-five centimeters long and gleaming with
the most cheerful colors; bluish gray dragonets with wrinkled heads;
myriads of leaping blennies with black stripes and long pectoral fins,
gliding over the surface of the water with prodigious speed;
delicious sailfish that can hoist their fins in a favorable current
like so many unfurled sails; splendid nurseryfish on which nature
has lavished yellow, azure, silver, and gold; yellow mackerel
with wings made of filaments; bullheads forever spattered with mud,
which make distinct hissing sounds; sea robins whose livers are thought
to be poisonous; ladyfish that can flutter their eyelids; finally,
archerfish with long, tubular snouts, real oceangoing flycatchers,
armed with a rifle unforeseen by either Remington or Chassepot:
it slays insects by shooting them with a simple drop of water.</p>

<p id="id02025">From the eighty-ninth fish genus in Lacépède's system of classification,
belonging to his second subclass of bony fish (characterized by gill
covers and a bronchial membrane), I noted some scorpionfish whose
heads are adorned with stings and which have only one dorsal fin;
these animals are covered with small scales, or have none at all,
depending on the subgenus to which they belong.  The second subgenus
gave us some Didactylus specimens three to four decimeters long,
streaked with yellow, their heads having a phantasmagoric appearance.
As for the first subgenus, it furnished several specimens of that
bizarre fish aptly nicknamed "toadfish," whose big head is sometimes
gouged with deep cavities, sometimes swollen with protuberances;
bristling with stings and strewn with nodules, it sports hideously
irregular horns; its body and tail are adorned with callosities;
its stings can inflict dangerous injuries; it's repulsive and horrible.</p>

<p id="id02026">From January 21 to the 23rd, the Nautilus traveled at the rate of 250
leagues in twenty-four hours, hence 540 miles at twenty-two miles
per hour.  If, during our trip, we were able to identify these different
varieties of fish, it's because they were attracted by our electric
light and tried to follow alongside; but most of them were outdistanced
by our speed and soon fell behind; temporarily, however, a few
managed to keep pace in the Nautilus's waters.</p>

<p id="id02027">On the morning of the 24th, in latitude 12 degrees 5'
south and longitude 94 degrees 33', we raised Keeling Island,
a madreporic upheaving planted with magnificent coconut trees,
which had been visited by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitzroy.  The Nautilus
cruised along a short distance off the shore of this desert island.
Our dragnets brought up many specimens of polyps and echinoderms
plus some unusual shells from the branch Mollusca.  Captain Nemo's
treasures were enhanced by some valuable exhibits from the delphinula
snail species, to which I joined some pointed star coral, a sort
of parasitic polypary that often attaches itself to seashells.</p>

<p id="id02028">Soon Keeling Island disappeared below the horizon, and our course
was set to the northwest, toward the tip of the Indian peninsula.</p>

<p id="id02029">"Civilization!"  Ned Land told me that day.  "Much better than
those Papuan Islands where we ran into more savages than venison!
On this Indian shore, professor, there are roads and railways,
English, French, and Hindu villages.  We wouldn't go five miles
without bumping into a fellow countryman.  Come on now, isn't it
time for our sudden departure from Captain Nemo?"</p>

<p id="id02030">"No, no, Ned," I replied in a very firm tone.  "Let's ride it out,
as you seafaring fellows say.  The Nautilus is approaching
populated areas.  It's going back toward Europe, let it take us there.
After we arrive in home waters, we can do as we see fit.
Besides, I don't imagine Captain Nemo will let us go hunting
on the coasts of Malabar or Coromandel as he did in the forests
of New Guinea."</p>

<p id="id02031">"Well, sir, can't we manage without his permission?"</p>

<p id="id02032">I didn't answer the Canadian.  I wanted no arguments.  Deep down,
I was determined to fully exploit the good fortune that had put me
on board the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id02033">After leaving Keeling Island, our pace got generally slower.
It also got more unpredictable, often taking us to great depths.
Several times we used our slanting fins, which internal levers could
set at an oblique angle to our waterline.  Thus we went as deep
as two or three kilometers down but without ever verifying the lowest
depths of this sea near India, which soundings of 13,000 meters have
been unable to reach.  As for the temperature in these lower strata,
the thermometer always and invariably indicated 4 degrees centigrade.
I merely observed that in the upper layers, the water was always
colder over shallows than in the open sea.</p>

<p id="id02034">On January 25, the ocean being completely deserted, the Nautilus spent
the day on the surface, churning the waves with its powerful propeller
and making them spurt to great heights.  Under these conditions,
who wouldn't have mistaken it for a gigantic cetacean?  I spent
three-quarters of the day on the platform.  I stared at the sea.
Nothing on the horizon, except near four o'clock in the afternoon
a long steamer to the west, running on our opposite tack.
Its masting was visible for an instant, but it couldn't have
seen the Nautilus because we were lying too low in the water.
I imagine that steamboat belonged to the Peninsular &amp; Oriental line,
which provides service from the island of Ceylon to Sidney,
also calling at King George Sound and Melbourne.</p>

<p id="id02035">At five o'clock in the afternoon, just before that brief twilight
that links day with night in tropical zones, Conseil and I marveled
at an unusual sight.</p>

<p id="id02036">It was a delightful animal whose discovery, according to the ancients,
is a sign of good luck.  Aristotle, Athenaeus, Pliny, and Oppian
studied its habits and lavished on its behalf all the scientific poetry
of Greece and Italy.  They called it "nautilus" and "pompilius."
But modern science has not endorsed these designations, and this
mollusk is now known by the name argonaut.</p>

<p id="id02037">Anyone consulting Conseil would soon learn from the gallant lad
that the branch Mollusca is divided into five classes; that the first
class features the Cephalopoda (whose members are sometimes naked,
sometimes covered with a shell), which consists of two families,
the Dibranchiata and the Tetrabranchiata, which are distinguished
by their number of gills; that the family Dibranchiata includes
three genera, the argonaut, the squid, and the cuttlefish, and that
the family Tetrabranchiata contains only one genus, the nautilus.
After this catalog, if some recalcitrant listener confuses
the argonaut, which is acetabuliferous (in other words, a bearer
of suction tubes), with the nautilus, which is tentaculiferous
(a bearer of tentacles), it will be simply unforgivable.</p>

<p id="id02038">Now, it was a school of argonauts then voyaging on the surface
of the ocean.  We could count several hundred of them.
They belonged to that species of argonaut covered with protuberances
and exclusive to the seas near India.</p>

<p id="id02039">These graceful mollusks were swimming backward by means of their
locomotive tubes, sucking water into these tubes and then expelling it.
Six of their eight tentacles were long, thin, and floated
on the water, while the other two were rounded into palms
and spread to the wind like light sails.  I could see perfectly
their undulating, spiral-shaped shells, which Cuvier aptly
compared to an elegant cockleboat.  It's an actual boat indeed.
It transports the animal that secretes it without the animal
sticking to it.</p>

<p id="id02040">"The argonaut is free to leave its shell," I told Conseil,
"but it never does."</p>

<p id="id02041">"Not unlike Captain Nemo," Conseil replied sagely.  "Which is why
he should have christened his ship the Argonaut."</p>

<p id="id02042">For about an hour the Nautilus cruised in the midst of this school
of mollusks.  Then, lord knows why, they were gripped with a sudden fear.
As if at a signal, every sail was abruptly lowered; arms folded,
bodies contracted, shells turned over by changing their center
of gravity, and the whole flotilla disappeared under the waves.
It was instantaneous, and no squadron of ships ever maneuvered
with greater togetherness.</p>

<p id="id02043">Just then night fell suddenly, and the waves barely surged in the breeze,
spreading placidly around the Nautilus's side plates.</p>

<p id="id02044">The next day, January 26, we cut the equator on the 82nd meridian
and we reentered the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p id="id02045">During that day a fearsome school of sharks provided us with an escort.
Dreadful animals that teem in these seas and make them
extremely dangerous.  There were Port Jackson sharks with a brown back,
a whitish belly, and eleven rows of teeth, bigeye sharks with necks
marked by a large black spot encircled in white and resembling an eye,
and Isabella sharks whose rounded snouts were strewn with dark speckles.
Often these powerful animals rushed at the lounge window with a
violence less than comforting.  By this point Ned Land had lost
all self-control. He wanted to rise to the surface of the waves
and harpoon the monsters, especially certain smooth-hound sharks whose
mouths were paved with teeth arranged like a mosaic, and some big
five-meter tiger sharks that insisted on personally provoking him.
But the Nautilus soon picked up speed and easily left astern
the fastest of these man-eaters.</p>

<p id="id02046">On January 27, at the entrance to the huge Bay of Bengal,
we repeatedly encountered a gruesome sight:  human corpses floating
on the surface of the waves!  Carried by the Ganges to the high seas,
these were deceased Indian villagers who hadn't been fully devoured
by vultures, the only morticians in these parts.  But there was no
shortage of sharks to assist them with their undertaking chores.</p>

<p id="id02047">Near seven o'clock in the evening, the Nautilus lay
half submerged, navigating in the midst of milky white waves.
As far as the eye could see, the ocean seemed lactified.
Was it an effect of the moon's rays?  No, because the new moon was barely
two days old and was still lost below the horizon in the sun's rays.
The entire sky, although lit up by stellar radiation, seemed pitch-black
in comparison with the whiteness of these waters.</p>

<p id="id02048">Conseil couldn't believe his eyes, and he questioned me about
the causes of this odd phenomenon.  Luckily I was in a position
to answer him.</p>

<p id="id02049">"That's called a milk sea," I told him, "a vast expanse of white waves
often seen along the coasts of Amboina and in these waterways."</p>

<p id="id02050">"But," Conseil asked, "could master tell me the cause of this effect,
because I presume this water hasn't really changed into milk!"</p>

<p id="id02051">"No, my boy, and this whiteness that amazes you is merely due
to the presence of myriads of tiny creatures called infusoria,
a sort of diminutive glowworm that's colorless and gelatinous
in appearance, as thick as a strand of hair, and no longer than
one-fifth of a millimeter.  Some of these tiny creatures stick
together over an area of several leagues."</p>

<p id="id02052">"Several leagues!"  Conseil exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id02053">"Yes, my boy, and don't even try to compute the number of
these infusoria.  You won't pull it off, because if I'm not mistaken,
certain navigators have cruised through milk seas for more
than forty miles."</p>

<p id="id02054">I'm not sure that Conseil heeded my recommendation, because he seemed
to be deep in thought, no doubt trying to calculate how many
one-fifths of a millimeter are found in forty square miles.
As for me, I continued to observe this phenomenon.  For several
hours the Nautilus's spur sliced through these whitish waves,
and I watched it glide noiselessly over this soapy water, as if it
were cruising through those foaming eddies that a bay's currents
and countercurrents sometimes leave between each other.</p>

<p id="id02055">Near midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual hue, but behind us
all the way to the horizon, the skies kept mirroring the whiteness
of those waves and for a good while seemed imbued with the hazy
glow of an aurora borealis.</p>
