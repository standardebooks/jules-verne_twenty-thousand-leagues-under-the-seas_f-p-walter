<p id="id00890" style="margin-top: 3em">Everything through Electricity</p>

<p id="id00891" style="margin-top: 3em">"SIR," CAPTAIN NEMO SAID, showing me the instruments hanging on
the walls of his stateroom,</p>

<p id="id00892">"these are the devices needed to navigate the Nautilus.  Here, as in
the lounge, I always have them before my eyes, and they indicate
my position and exact heading in the midst of the ocean.
You're familiar with some of them, such as the thermometer,
which gives the temperature inside the Nautilus; the barometer,
which measures the heaviness of the outside air and forecasts changes
in the weather; the humidistat, which indicates the degree of dryness
in the atmosphere; the storm glass, whose mixture decomposes to
foretell the arrival of tempests; the compass, which steers my course;
the sextant, which takes the sun's altitude and tells me my latitude;
chronometers, which allow me to calculate my longitude; and finally,
spyglasses for both day and night, enabling me to scrutinize every
point of the horizon once the Nautilus has risen to the surface
of the waves."</p>

<p id="id00893">"These are the normal navigational instruments," I replied,
"and I'm familiar with their uses.  But no doubt these others answer
pressing needs unique to the Nautilus.  That dial I see there,
with the needle moving across it—isn't it a pressure gauge?"</p>

<p id="id00894">"It is indeed a pressure gauge.  It's placed in contact with the water,
and it indicates the outside pressure on our hull, which in turn
gives me the depth at which my submersible is sitting."</p>

<p id="id00895">"And these are some new breed of sounding line?"</p>

<p id="id00896">"They're thermometric sounding lines that report water temperatures
in the different strata."</p>

<p id="id00897">"And these other instruments, whose functions I can't even guess?"</p>

<p id="id00898">"Here, professor, I need to give you some background information,"<br/>

Captain Nemo said.  "So kindly hear me out."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00899">He fell silent for some moments, then he said:</p>

<p id="id00900">"There's a powerful, obedient, swift, and effortless force that can
be bent to any use and which reigns supreme aboard my vessel.
It does everything.  It lights me, it warms me, it's the soul
of my mechanical equipment.  This force is electricity."</p>

<p id="id00901">"Electricity!"  I exclaimed in some surprise.</p>

<p id="id00902">"Yes, sir."</p>

<p id="id00903">"But, captain, you have a tremendous speed of movement that doesn't
square with the strength of electricity.  Until now, its dynamic
potential has remained quite limited, capable of producing only small
amounts of power!"</p>

<p id="id00904">"Professor," Captain Nemo replied, "my electricity isn't
the run-of-the-mill variety, and with your permission, I'll leave
it at that."</p>

<p id="id00905">"I won't insist, sir, and I'll rest content with simply being
flabbergasted at your results.  I would ask one question, however,
which you needn't answer if it's indiscreet.  The electric cells you
use to generate this marvelous force must be depleted very quickly.
Their zinc component, for example:  how do you replace it,
since you no longer stay in contact with the shore?"</p>

<p id="id00906">"That question deserves an answer," Captain Nemo replied.
"First off, I'll mention that at the bottom of the sea there exist veins
of zinc, iron, silver, and gold whose mining would quite certainly
be feasible.  But I've tapped none of these land-based metals,
and I wanted to make demands only on the sea itself for the sources
of my electricity."</p>

<p id="id00907">"The sea itself?"</p>

<p id="id00908">"Yes, professor, and there was no shortage of such sources.
In fact, by establishing a circuit between two wires immersed
to different depths, I'd be able to obtain electricity through
the diverging temperatures they experience; but I preferred to use
a more practical procedure."</p>

<p id="id00909">"And that is?"</p>

<p id="id00910">"You're familiar with the composition of salt water.  In 1,000 grams
one finds 96.5% water and about 2.66% sodium chloride; then small
quantities of magnesium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium bromide,
sulfate of magnesia, calcium sulfate, and calcium carbonate.
Hence you observe that sodium chloride is encountered there in
significant proportions.  Now then, it's this sodium that I extract
from salt water and with which I compose my electric cells."</p>

<p id="id00911">"Sodium?"</p>

<p id="id00912">"Yes, sir.  Mixed with mercury, it forms an amalgam that takes
the place of zinc in Bunsen cells.  The mercury is never depleted.
Only the sodium is consumed, and the sea itself gives me that.
Beyond this, I'll mention that sodium batteries have been found
to generate the greater energy, and their electro-motor strength
is twice that of zinc batteries."</p>

<p id="id00913">"Captain, I fully understand the excellence of sodium under the conditions
in which you're placed.  The sea contains it.  Fine.  But it still has
to be produced, in short, extracted.  And how do you accomplish this?
Obviously your batteries could do the extracting; but if I'm
not mistaken, the consumption of sodium needed by your electric
equipment would be greater than the quantity you'd extract.
It would come about, then, that in the process of producing your sodium,
you'd use up more than you'd make!"</p>

<p id="id00914">"Accordingly, professor, I don't extract it with batteries;
quite simply, I utilize the heat of coal from the earth."</p>

<p id="id00915">"From the earth?"  I said, my voice going up on the word.</p>

<p id="id00916">"We'll say coal from the seafloor, if you prefer," Captain Nemo replied.</p>

<p id="id00917">"And you can mine these veins of underwater coal?"</p>

<p id="id00918">"You'll watch me work them, Professor Aronnax.  I ask only a little
patience of you, since you'll have ample time to be patient.
Just remember one thing:  I owe everything to the ocean;
it generates electricity, and electricity gives the Nautilus heat,
light, motion, and, in a word, life itself."</p>

<p id="id00919">"But not the air you breathe?"</p>

<p id="id00920">"Oh, I could produce the air needed on board, but it would be pointless,
since I can rise to the surface of the sea whenever I like.
However, even though electricity doesn't supply me with breathable air,
it at least operates the powerful pumps that store it under pressure
in special tanks; which, if need be, allows me to extend my stay
in the lower strata for as long as I want."</p>

<p id="id00921">"Captain," I replied, "I'll rest content with marveling.
You've obviously found what all mankind will surely find one day,
the true dynamic power of electricity."</p>

<p id="id00922">"I'm not so certain they'll find it," Captain Nemo replied icily.
"But be that as it may, you're already familiar with the first use I've
found for this valuable force.  It lights us, and with a uniformity
and continuity not even possessed by sunlight.  Now, look at that clock:
it's electric, it runs with an accuracy rivaling the finest chronometers.
I've had it divided into twenty-four hours like Italian clocks,
since neither day nor night, sun nor moon, exist for me, but only
this artificial light that I import into the depths of the seas!
See, right now it's ten o'clock in the morning."</p>

<p id="id00923">"That's perfect."</p>

<p id="id00924">"Another use for electricity:  that dial hanging before our eyes
indicates how fast the Nautilus is going.  An electric wire puts
it in contact with the patent log; this needle shows me the actual
speed of my submersible.  And . . . hold on . . . just now we're
proceeding at the moderate pace of fifteen miles per hour."</p>

<p id="id00925">"It's marvelous," I replied, "and I truly see, captain, how right
you are to use this force; it's sure to take the place of wind,
water, and steam."</p>

<p id="id00926">"But that's not all, Professor Aronnax," Captain Nemo said, standing up.<br/>

"And if you'd care to follow me, we'll inspect the Nautilus's stern."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00927">In essence, I was already familiar with the whole forward part
of this underwater boat, and here are its exact subdivisions going
from amidships to its spur:  the dining room, 5 meters long and
separated from the library by a watertight bulkhead, in other words,
it couldn't be penetrated by the sea; the library, 5 meters long;
the main lounge, 10 meters long, separated from the captain's
stateroom by a second watertight bulkhead; the aforesaid stateroom,
5 meters long; mine, 2.5 meters long; and finally, air tanks 7.5 meters
long and extending to the stempost.  Total:  a length of 35 meters.
Doors were cut into the watertight bulkheads and were shut hermetically
by means of india-rubber seals, which insured complete safety aboard
the Nautilus in the event of a leak in any one section.</p>

<p id="id00928">I followed Captain Nemo down gangways located for easy transit,
and I arrived amidships.  There I found a sort of shaft heading upward
between two watertight bulkheads.  An iron ladder, clamped to the wall,
led to the shaft's upper end.  I asked the captain what this
ladder was for.</p>

<p id="id00929">"It goes to the skiff," he replied.</p>

<p id="id00930">"What!  You have a skiff?"  I replied in some astonishment.</p>

<p id="id00931">"Surely.  An excellent longboat, light and unsinkable, which is used
for excursions and fishing trips."</p>

<p id="id00932">"But when you want to set out, don't you have to return to the surface
of the sea?"</p>

<p id="id00933">"By no means.  The skiff is attached to the topside of the Nautilus's hull
and is set in a cavity expressly designed to receive it.  It's completely
decked over, absolutely watertight, and held solidly in place by bolts.
This ladder leads to a manhole cut into the Nautilus's hull and
corresponding to a comparable hole cut into the side of the skiff.
I insert myself through this double opening into the longboat.
My crew close up the hole belonging to the Nautilus; I close up
the one belonging to the skiff, simply by screwing it into place.
I undo the bolts holding the skiff to the submersible, and the
longboat rises with prodigious speed to the surface of the sea.
I then open the deck paneling, carefully closed until that point;
I up mast and hoist sail—or I take out my oars—and I go for a spin."</p>

<p id="id00934">"But how do you return to the ship?"</p>

<p id="id00935">"I don't, Professor Aronnax; the Nautilus returns to me."</p>

<p id="id00936">"At your command?"</p>

<p id="id00937">"At my command.  An electric wire connects me to the ship.<br/>

I fire off a telegram, and that's that."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id00938">"Right," I said, tipsy from all these wonders, "nothing to it!"</p>

<p id="id00939">After passing the well of the companionway that led to the platform,
I saw a cabin 2 meters long in which Conseil and Ned Land,
enraptured with their meal, were busy devouring it to the last crumb.
Then a door opened into the galley, 3 meters long and located
between the vessel's huge storage lockers.</p>

<p id="id00940">There, even more powerful and obedient than gas, electricity did
most of the cooking.  Arriving under the stoves, wires transmitted
to platinum griddles a heat that was distributed and sustained
with perfect consistency.  It also heated a distilling
mechanism that, via evaporation, supplied excellent drinking water.
Next to this galley was a bathroom, conveniently laid out,
with faucets supplying hot or cold water at will.</p>

<p id="id00941">After the galley came the crew's quarters, 5 meters long.
But the door was closed and I couldn't see its accommodations, which might
have told me the number of men it took to operate the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id00942">At the far end stood a fourth watertight bulkhead, separating the crew's
quarters from the engine room.  A door opened, and I stood in the
compartment where Captain Nemo, indisputably a world-class engineer,
had set up his locomotive equipment.</p>

<p id="id00943">Brightly lit, the engine room measured at least 20 meters in length.
It was divided, by function, into two parts:  the first contained
the cells for generating electricity, the second that mechanism
transmitting movement to the propeller.</p>

<p id="id00944">Right off, I detected an odor permeating the compartment that was
sui generis.* Captain Nemo noticed the negative impression it
made on me.</p>

<p id="id00945">*Latin: "in a class by itself."  Ed.</p>

<p id="id00946">"That," he told me, "is a gaseous discharge caused by our use of sodium,
but it's only a mild inconvenience.  In any event, every morning
we sanitize the ship by ventilating it in the open air."</p>

<p id="id00947">Meanwhile I examined the Nautilus's engine with a fascination
easy to imagine.</p>

<p id="id00948">"You observe," Captain Nemo told me, "that I use Bunsen cells,
not Ruhmkorff cells.  The latter would be ineffectual.  One uses fewer
Bunsen cells, but they're big and strong, and experience has proven
their superiority.  The electricity generated here makes its way to
the stern, where electromagnets of huge size activate a special system
of levers and gears that transmit movement to the propeller's shaft.
The latter has a diameter of 6 meters, a pitch of 7.5 meters,
and can do up to 120 revolutions per minute."</p>

<p id="id00949">"And that gives you?"</p>

<p id="id00950">"A speed of fifty miles per hour."</p>

<p id="id00951">There lay a mystery, but I didn't insist on exploring it.
How could electricity work with such power?  Where did this
nearly unlimited energy originate?  Was it in the extraordinary
voltage obtained from some new kind of induction coil?
Could its transmission have been immeasurably increased by some
unknown system of levers?** This was the point I couldn't grasp.</p>

<p id="id00952">**Author's Note:  And sure enough, there's now talk of such a discovery,
in which a new set of levers generates considerable power.
Did its inventor meet up with Captain Nemo?</p>

<p id="id00953">"Captain Nemo," I said, "I'll vouch for the results and not try
to explain them.  I've seen the Nautilus at work out in front
of the Abraham Lincoln, and I know where I stand on its speed.
But it isn't enough just to move, we have to see where we're going!
We must be able to steer right or left, up or down!
How do you reach the lower depths, where you meet an increasing
resistance that's assessed in hundreds of atmospheres?
How do you rise back to the surface of the ocean?
Finally, how do you keep your ship at whatever level suits you?
Am I indiscreet in asking you all these things?"</p>

<p id="id00954">"Not at all, professor," the captain answered me after a
slight hesitation, "since you'll never leave this underwater boat.
Come into the lounge.  It's actually our work room, and there you'll
learn the full story about the Nautilus!"</p>

<h1 id="id00955" style="margin-top: 9em">CHAPTER 13</h1>

<p id="id00956" style="margin-top: 3em">Some Figures</p>

<p id="id00957" style="margin-top: 3em">A MOMENT LATER we were seated on a couch in the lounge, cigars between
our lips.  The</p>

<p id="id00958">captain placed before my eyes a working drawing that gave the ground plan,
cross section, and side view of the Nautilus.  Then he began his
description as follows:</p>

<p id="id00959">"Here, Professor Aronnax, are the different dimensions of this boat
now transporting you.  It's a very long cylinder with conical ends.
It noticeably takes the shape of a cigar, a shape already
adopted in London for several projects of the same kind.
The length of this cylinder from end to end is exactly seventy meters,
and its maximum breadth of beam is eight meters.  So it isn't
quite built on the ten-to-one ratio of your high-speed steamers;
but its lines are sufficiently long, and their tapering gradual enough,
so that the displaced water easily slips past and poses no obstacle
to the ship's movements.</p>

<p id="id00960">"These two dimensions allow you to obtain, via a simple calculation,
the surface area and volume of the Nautilus.  Its surface area
totals 1,011.45 square meters, its volume 1,507.2 cubic meters—
which is tantamount to saying that when it's completely submerged,
it displaces 1,500 cubic meters of water, or weighs 1,500 metric tons.</p>

<p id="id00961">"In drawing up plans for a ship meant to navigate underwater,
I wanted it, when floating on the waves, to lie nine-tenths below
the surface and to emerge only one-tenth. Consequently, under these
conditions it needed to displace only nine-tenths of its volume,
hence 1,356.48 cubic meters; in other words, it was to weigh only
that same number of metric tons.  So I was obliged not to exceed
this weight while building it to the aforesaid dimensions.</p>

<p id="id00962">"The Nautilus is made up of two hulls, one inside the other;
between them, joining them together, are iron T-bars that give this ship
the utmost rigidity.  In fact, thanks to this cellular arrangement,
it has the resistance of a stone block, as if it were completely solid.
Its plating can't give way; it's self-adhering and not dependent
on the tightness of its rivets; and due to the perfect union
of its materials, the solidarity of its construction allows it
to defy the most violent seas.</p>

<p id="id00963">"The two hulls are manufactured from boilerplate steel, whose relative
density is 7.8 times that of water.  The first hull has a thickness
of no less than five centimeters and weighs 394.96 metric tons.
My second hull, the outer cover, includes a keel fifty centimeters high
by twenty-five wide, which by itself weighs 62 metric tons; this hull,
the engine, the ballast, the various accessories and accommodations,
plus the bulkheads and interior braces, have a combined weight
of 961.52 metric tons, which when added to 394.96 metric tons,
gives us the desired total of 1,356.48 metric tons.  Clear?"</p>

<p id="id00964">"Clear," I replied.</p>

<p id="id00965">"So," the captain went on, "when the Nautilus lies on the waves
under these conditions, one-tenth of it does emerge above water.
Now then, if I provide some ballast tanks equal in capacity
to that one-tenth, hence able to hold 150.72 metric tons, and if I
fill them with water, the boat then displaces 1,507.2 metric tons—
or it weighs that much—and it would be completely submerged.
That's what comes about, professor.  These ballast tanks exist
within easy access in the lower reaches of the Nautilus.  I open
some stopcocks, the tanks fill, the boat sinks, and it's exactly
flush with the surface of the water."</p>

<p id="id00966">"Fine, captain, but now we come to a genuine difficulty.  You're able
to lie flush with the surface of the ocean, that I understand.
But lower down, while diving beneath that surface, isn't your
submersible going to encounter a pressure, and consequently
undergo an upward thrust, that must be assessed at one atmosphere
per every thirty feet of water, hence at about one kilogram per
each square centimeter?"</p>

<p id="id00967">"Precisely, sir."</p>

<p id="id00968">"Then unless you fill up the whole Nautilus, I don't see how you
can force it down into the heart of these liquid masses."</p>

<p id="id00969">"Professor," Captain Nemo replied, "static objects mustn't be
confused with dynamic ones, or we'll be open to serious error.
Comparatively little effort is spent in reaching the ocean's
lower regions, because all objects have a tendency to become 'sinkers.'
Follow my logic here."</p>

<p id="id00970">"I'm all ears, captain."</p>

<p id="id00971">"When I wanted to determine what increase in weight the Nautilus
needed to be given in order to submerge, I had only to take note
of the proportionate reduction in volume that salt water experiences
in deeper and deeper strata."</p>

<p id="id00972">"That's obvious," I replied.</p>

<p id="id00973">"Now then, if water isn't absolutely incompressible, at least
it compresses very little.  In fact, according to the most
recent calculations, this reduction is only .0000436 per atmosphere,
or per every thirty feet of depth.  For instance, to go 1,000
meters down, I must take into account the reduction in volume
that occurs under a pressure equivalent to that from a 1,000-meter
column of water, in other words, under a pressure of 100 atmospheres.
In this instance the reduction would be .00436. Consequently, I'd have
to increase my weight from 1,507.2 metric tons to 1,513.77. So
the added weight would only be 6.57 metric tons."</p>

<p id="id00974">"That's all?"</p>

<p id="id00975">"That's all, Professor Aronnax, and the calculation is easy to check.
Now then, I have supplementary ballast tanks capable of shipping 100
metric tons of water.  So I can descend to considerable depths.
When I want to rise again and lie flush with the surface, all I
have to do is expel that water; and if I desire that the Nautilus
emerge above the waves to one-tenth of its total capacity, I empty
all the ballast tanks completely."</p>

<p id="id00976">This logic, backed up by figures, left me without a single objection.</p>

<p id="id00977">"I accept your calculations, captain," I replied, "and I'd be ill-mannered
to dispute them, since your daily experience bears them out.
But at this juncture, I have a hunch that we're still left with
one real difficulty."</p>

<p id="id00978">"What's that, sir?"</p>

<p id="id00979">"When you're at a depth of 1,000 meters, the Nautilus's plating
bears a pressure of 100 atmospheres.  If at this point you want
to empty the supplementary ballast tanks in order to lighten your
boat and rise to the surface, your pumps must overcome that pressure
of 100 atmospheres, which is 100 kilograms per each square centimeter.
This demands a strength—"</p>

<p id="id00980">"That electricity alone can give me," Captain Nemo said swiftly.
"Sir, I repeat:  the dynamic power of my engines is nearly infinite.
The Nautilus's pumps have prodigious strength, as you must
have noticed when their waterspouts swept like a torrent over
the Abraham Lincoln.  Besides, I use my supplementary ballast
tanks only to reach an average depth of 1,500 to 2,000 meters,
and that with a view to conserving my machinery.  Accordingly, when I
have a mind to visit the ocean depths two or three vertical leagues
beneath the surface, I use maneuvers that are more time-consuming
but no less infallible."</p>

<p id="id00981">"What are they, captain?"  I asked.</p>

<p id="id00982">"Here I'm naturally led into telling you how the Nautilus is maneuvered."</p>

<p id="id00983">"I can't wait to find out."</p>

<p id="id00984">"In order to steer this boat to port or starboard, in short, to make
turns on a horizontal plane, I use an ordinary, wide-bladed rudder
that's fastened to the rear of the sternpost and worked by a wheel
and tackle.  But I can also move the Nautilus upward and downward
on a vertical plane by the simple method of slanting its two fins,
which are attached to its sides at its center of flotation;
these fins are flexible, able to assume any position, and can be
operated from inside by means of powerful levers.  If these fins
stay parallel with the boat, the latter moves horizontally.
If they slant, the Nautilus follows the angle of that slant and,
under its propeller's thrust, either sinks on a diagonal as steep
as it suits me, or rises on that diagonal.  And similarly, if I want
to return more swiftly to the surface, I throw the propeller in gear,
and the water's pressure makes the Nautilus rise vertically, as an air
balloon inflated with hydrogen lifts swiftly into the skies."</p>

<p id="id00985">"Bravo, captain!"  I exclaimed.  "But in the midst of the waters,
how can your helmsman follow the course you've given him?"</p>

<p id="id00986">"My helmsman is stationed behind the windows of a pilothouse,
which protrudes from the topside of the Nautilus's hull and is fitted
with biconvex glass."</p>

<p id="id00987">"Is glass capable of resisting such pressures?"</p>

<p id="id00988">"Perfectly capable.  Though fragile on impact, crystal can still
offer considerable resistance.  In 1864, during experiments on
fishing by electric light in the middle of the North Sea, glass panes
less than seven millimeters thick were seen to resist a pressure
of sixteen atmospheres, all the while letting through strong,
heat-generating rays whose warmth was unevenly distributed.
Now then, I use glass windows measuring no less than twenty-one
centimeters at their centers; in other words, they've thirty
times the thickness."</p>

<p id="id00989">"Fair enough, captain, but if we're going to see, we need light
to drive away the dark, and in the midst of the murky waters,
I wonder how your helmsman can—"</p>

<p id="id00990">"Set astern of the pilothouse is a powerful electric reflector
whose rays light up the sea for a distance of half a mile."</p>

<p id="id00991">"Oh, bravo!  Bravo three times over, captain!  That explains
the phosphorescent glow from this so-called narwhale that so puzzled
us scientists!  Pertinent to this, I'll ask you if the Nautilus's
running afoul of the Scotia, which caused such a great uproar,
was the result of an accidental encounter?"</p>

<p id="id00992">"Entirely accidental, sir.  I was navigating two meters beneath
the surface of the water when the collision occurred.  However, I could
see that it had no dire consequences."</p>

<p id="id00993">"None, sir.  But as for your encounter with the Abraham Lincoln . . . ?"</p>

<p id="id00994">"Professor, that troubled me, because it's one of the best ships in the
gallant American navy, but they attacked me and I had to defend myself!
All the same, I was content simply to put the frigate in a condition
where it could do me no harm; it won't have any difficulty getting
repairs at the nearest port."</p>

<p id="id00995">"Ah, commander," I exclaimed with conviction, "your Nautilus is truly
a marvelous boat!"</p>

<p id="id00996">"Yes, professor," Captain Nemo replied with genuine excitement,
"and I love it as if it were my own flesh and blood!  Aboard a
conventional ship, facing the ocean's perils, danger lurks everywhere;
on the surface of the sea, your chief sensation is the constant feeling
of an underlying chasm, as the Dutchman Jansen so aptly put it;
but below the waves aboard the Nautilus, your heart never fails you!
There are no structural deformities to worry about,
because the double hull of this boat has the rigidity of iron;
no rigging to be worn out by rolling and pitching on the waves;
no sails for the wind to carry off; no boilers for steam to burst open;
no fires to fear, because this submersible is made of sheet iron not wood;
no coal to run out of, since electricity is its mechanical force;
no collisions to fear, because it navigates the watery deep all by itself;
no storms to brave, because just a few meters beneath the waves,
it finds absolute tranquility!  There, sir.  There's the ideal ship!
And if it's true that the engineer has more confidence in a craft
than the builder, and the builder more than the captain himself,
you can understand the utter abandon with which I place my trust
in this Nautilus, since I'm its captain, builder, and engineer
all in one!"</p>

<p id="id00997">Captain Nemo spoke with winning eloquence.  The fire in his eyes
and the passion in his gestures transfigured him.  Yes, he loved
his ship the same way a father loves his child!</p>

<p id="id00998">But one question, perhaps indiscreet, naturally popped up, and I
couldn't resist asking it.</p>

<p id="id00999">"You're an engineer, then, Captain Nemo?"</p>

<p id="id01000">"Yes, professor," he answered me.  "I studied in London, Paris,
and New York back in the days when I was a resident of
the earth's continents."</p>

<p id="id01001">"But how were you able to build this wonderful Nautilus in secret?"</p>

<p id="id01002">"Each part of it, Professor Aronnax, came from a different spot
on the globe and reached me at a cover address.  Its keel was forged
by Creusot in France, its propeller shaft by Pen &amp; Co.  in London,
the sheet-iron plates for its hull by Laird's in Liverpool, its propeller
by Scott's in Glasgow.  Its tanks were manufactured by Cail &amp; Co.
in Paris, its engine by Krupp in Prussia, its spur by the Motala
workshops in Sweden, its precision instruments by Hart Bros.
in New York, etc.; and each of these suppliers received my
specifications under a different name."</p>

<p id="id01003">"But," I went on, "once these parts were manufactured, didn't they
have to be mounted and adjusted?"</p>

<p id="id01004">"Professor, I set up my workshops on a deserted islet in midocean.
There our Nautilus was completed by me and my workmen, in other words,
by my gallant companions whom I've molded and educated.
Then, when the operation was over, we burned every trace of our stay
on that islet, which if I could have, I'd have blown up."</p>

<p id="id01005">"From all this, may I assume that such a boat costs a fortune?"</p>

<p id="id01006">"An iron ship, Professor Aronnax, runs 1,125 francs per metric ton.
Now then, the Nautilus has a burden of 1,500 metric tons.
Consequently, it cost 1,687,000 francs, hence 2,000,000 francs
including its accommodations, and 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 with all
the collections and works of art it contains."</p>

<p id="id01007">"One last question, Captain Nemo."</p>

<p id="id01008">"Ask, professor."</p>

<p id="id01009">"You're rich, then?"</p>

<p id="id01010">"Infinitely rich, sir, and without any trouble, I could pay off
the ten-billion-franc French national debt!"</p>

<p id="id01011">I gaped at the bizarre individual who had just spoken these words.<br/>

Was he playing on my credulity?  Time would tell.<br/>
</p>

<h1 id="id01012" style="margin-top: 8em">CHAPTER 14</h1>

<p id="id01013" style="margin-top: 3em">The Black Current</p>

<p id="id01014" style="margin-top: 3em">THE PART OF THE planet earth that the seas occupy has been assessed at
3,832,558 square myriameters, hence more than 38,000,000,000 hectares.
This liquid mass totals 2,250,000,000 cubic miles and could form
a sphere with a diameter of sixty leagues, whose weight would
be three quintillion metric tons.  To appreciate such a number,
we should remember that a quintillion is to a billion what a billion
is to one, in other words, there are as many billions in a quintillion
as ones in a billion!  Now then, this liquid mass nearly equals
the total amount of water that has poured through all the earth's
rivers for the past 40,000 years!</p>

<p id="id01015">During prehistoric times, an era of fire was followed by an era of water.
At first there was ocean everywhere.  Then, during the Silurian period,
the tops of mountains gradually appeared above the waves,
islands emerged, disappeared beneath temporary floods, rose again,
were fused to form continents, and finally the earth's geography
settled into what we have today.  Solid matter had wrested from liquid
matter some 37,657,000 square miles, hence 12,916,000,000 hectares.</p>

<p id="id01016">The outlines of the continents allow the seas to be divided
into five major parts:  the frozen Arctic and Antarctic oceans,
the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p id="id01017">The Pacific Ocean extends north to south between the two polar circles
and east to west between America and Asia over an expanse of 145
degrees of longitude.  It's the most tranquil of the seas; its currents
are wide and slow-moving, its tides moderate, its rainfall abundant.
And this was the ocean that I was first destined to cross under
these strangest of auspices.</p>

<p id="id01018">"If you don't mind, professor," Captain Nemo told me, "we'll determine
our exact position and fix the starting point of our voyage.
It's fifteen minutes before noon.  I'm going to rise to the surface
of the water."</p>

<p id="id01019">The captain pressed an electric bell three times.  The pumps began
to expel water from the ballast tanks; on the pressure gauge,
a needle marked the decreasing pressures that indicated the Nautilus's
upward progress; then the needle stopped.</p>

<p id="id01020">"Here we are," the captain said.</p>

<p id="id01021">I made my way to the central companionway, which led to the platform.
I climbed its metal steps, passed through the open hatches,
and arrived topside on the Nautilus.</p>

<p id="id01022">The platform emerged only eighty centimeters above the waves.
The Nautilus's bow and stern boasted that spindle-shaped outline
that had caused the ship to be compared appropriately to a long cigar.
I noted the slight overlap of its sheet-iron plates, which resembled
the scales covering the bodies of our big land reptiles.  So I had
a perfectly natural explanation for why, despite the best spyglasses,
this boat had always been mistaken for a marine animal.</p>

<p id="id01023">Near the middle of the platform, the skiff was half set in the
ship's hull, making a slight bulge.  Fore and aft stood two cupolas
of moderate height, their sides slanting and partly inset with heavy
biconvex glass, one reserved for the helmsman steering the Nautilus,
the other for the brilliance of the powerful electric beacon
lighting his way.</p>

<p id="id01024">The sea was magnificent, the skies clear.  This long aquatic<br/>

vehicle could barely feel the broad undulations of the ocean.<br/>

A mild breeze out of the east rippled the surface of the water.<br/>

Free of all mist, the horizon was ideal for taking sights.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01025">There was nothing to be seen.  Not a reef, not an islet.<br/>

No more Abraham Lincoln.  A deserted immenseness.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01026">Raising his sextant, Captain Nemo took the altitude of the sun,
which would give him his latitude.  He waited for a few minutes
until the orb touched the rim of the horizon.  While he was taking
his sights, he didn't move a muscle, and the instrument couldn't
have been steadier in hands made out of marble.</p>

<p id="id01027">"Noon," he said.  "Professor, whenever you're ready. . . ."</p>

<p id="id01028">I took one last look at the sea, a little yellowish near the landing
places of Japan, and I went below again to the main lounge.</p>

<p id="id01029">There the captain fixed his position and used a chronometer
to calculate his longitude, which he double-checked against his
previous observations of hour angles.  Then he told me:</p>

<p id="id01030">"Professor Aronnax, we're in longitude 137 degrees 15' west—"</p>

<p id="id01031">"West of which meridian?"  I asked quickly, hoping the captain's
reply might give me a clue to his nationality.</p>

<p id="id01032">"Sir," he answered me, "I have chronometers variously set to the
meridians of Paris, Greenwich, and Washington, D.C. But in your honor,
I'll use the one for Paris."</p>

<p id="id01033">This reply told me nothing.  I bowed, and the commander went on:</p>

<p id="id01034">"We're in longitude 137 degrees 15' west of the meridian of Paris,
and latitude 30 degrees 7' north, in other words, about 300 miles
from the shores of Japan.  At noon on this day of November 8,
we hereby begin our voyage of exploration under the waters."</p>

<p id="id01035">"May God be with us!"  I replied.</p>

<p id="id01036">"And now, professor," the captain added, "I'll leave you to your
intellectual pursuits.  I've set our course east-northeast at a depth
of fifty meters.  Here are some large-scale charts on which you'll
be able to follow that course.  The lounge is at your disposal,
and with your permission, I'll take my leave."</p>

<p id="id01037">Captain Nemo bowed.  I was left to myself, lost in my thoughts.
They all centered on the Nautilus's commander.  Would I ever learn
the nationality of this eccentric man who had boasted of having none?
His sworn hate for humanity, a hate that perhaps was bent
on some dreadful revenge—what had provoked it?  Was he one of
those unappreciated scholars, one of those geniuses "embittered
by the world," as Conseil expressed it, a latter-day Galileo,
or maybe one of those men of science, like America's Commander Maury,
whose careers were ruined by political revolutions?  I couldn't say yet.
As for me, whom fate had just brought aboard his vessel,
whose life he had held in the balance:  he had received me coolly
but hospitably.  Only, he never took the hand I extended to him.
He never extended his own.</p>

<p id="id01038">For an entire hour I was deep in these musings, trying to probe this
mystery that fascinated me so.  Then my eyes focused on a huge world
map displayed on the table, and I put my finger on the very spot
where our just-determined longitude and latitude intersected.</p>

<p id="id01039">Like the continents, the sea has its rivers.  These are exclusive
currents that can be identified by their temperature and color,
the most remarkable being the one called the Gulf Stream.
Science has defined the global paths of five chief currents:
one in the north Atlantic, a second in the south Atlantic,
a third in the north Pacific, a fourth in the south Pacific,
and a fifth in the southern Indian Ocean.  Also it's likely
that a sixth current used to exist in the northern Indian Ocean,
when the Caspian and Aral Seas joined up with certain large Asian
lakes to form a single uniform expanse of water.</p>

<p id="id01040">Now then, at the spot indicated on the world map, one of these seagoing
rivers was rolling by, the Kuroshio of the Japanese, the Black Current:
heated by perpendicular rays from the tropical sun, it leaves the Bay
of Bengal, crosses the Strait of Malacca, goes up the shores of Asia,
and curves into the north Pacific as far as the Aleutian Islands,
carrying along trunks of camphor trees and other local items, the pure
indigo of its warm waters sharply contrasting with the ocean's waves.
It was this current the Nautilus was about to cross.
I watched it on the map with my eyes, I saw it lose itself in the
immenseness of the Pacific, and I felt myself swept along with it,
when Ned Land and Conseil appeared in the lounge doorway.</p>

<p id="id01041">My two gallant companions stood petrified at the sight of the
wonders on display.</p>

<p id="id01042">"Where are we?" the Canadian exclaimed.  "In the Quebec Museum?"</p>

<p id="id01043">"Begging master's pardon," Conseil answered, "but this seems more
like the Sommerard artifacts exhibition!"</p>

<p id="id01044">"My friends," I replied, signaling them to enter, "you're in neither
Canada nor France, but securely aboard the Nautilus, fifty meters
below sea level."</p>

<p id="id01045">"If master says so, then so be it," Conseil answered.<br/>

"But in all honesty, this lounge is enough to astonish even someone<br/>

Flemish like myself."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01046">"Indulge your astonishment, my friend, and have a look, because there's
plenty of work here for a classifier of your talents."</p>

<p id="id01047">Conseil needed no encouraging.  Bending over the glass cases,
the gallant lad was already muttering choice words from the
naturalist's vocabulary:  class Gastropoda, family Buccinoidea,
genus cowry, species Cypraea madagascariensis, etc.</p>

<p id="id01048">Meanwhile Ned Land, less dedicated to conchology, questioned me
about my interview with Captain Nemo.  Had I discovered who he was,
where he came from, where he was heading, how deep he was taking us?
In short, a thousand questions I had no time to answer.</p>

<p id="id01049">I told him everything I knew—or, rather, everything I didn't know—
and I asked him what he had seen or heard on his part.</p>

<p id="id01050">"Haven't seen or heard a thing!" the Canadian replied.
"I haven't even spotted the crew of this boat.  By any chance,
could they be electric too?"</p>

<p id="id01051">"Electric?"</p>

<p id="id01052">"Oh ye gods, I'm half tempted to believe it!  But back to you,<br/>

Professor Aronnax," Ned Land said, still hanging on to his ideas.<br/>

"Can't you tell me how many men are on board?  Ten, twenty,<br/>

fifty, a hundred?"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01053">"I'm unable to answer you, Mr. Land.  And trust me on this:
for the time being, get rid of these notions of taking over
the Nautilus or escaping from it.  This boat is a masterpiece
of modern technology, and I'd be sorry to have missed it!
Many people would welcome the circumstances that have been handed us,
just to walk in the midst of these wonders.  So keep calm,
and let's see what's happening around us."</p>

<p id="id01054">"See!" the harpooner exclaimed.  "There's nothing to see,
nothing we'll ever see from this sheet-iron prison!  We're simply
running around blindfolded—"</p>

<p id="id01055">Ned Land was just pronouncing these last words when we were
suddenly plunged into darkness, utter darkness.  The ceiling lights
went out so quickly, my eyes literally ached, just as if we had
experienced the opposite sensation of going from the deepest gloom
to the brightest sunlight.</p>

<p id="id01056">We stood stock-still, not knowing what surprise was waiting for us,
whether pleasant or unpleasant.  But a sliding sound became audible.
You could tell that some panels were shifting over the Nautilus's sides.</p>

<p id="id01057">"It's the beginning of the end!"  Ned Land said.</p>

<p id="id01058">". . . order Hydromedusa," Conseil muttered.</p>

<p id="id01059">Suddenly, through two oblong openings, daylight appeared on both
sides of the lounge.  The liquid masses came into view, brightly lit
by the ship's electric outpourings.  We were separated from the sea
by two panes of glass.  Initially I shuddered at the thought
that these fragile partitions could break; but strong copper bands
secured them, giving them nearly infinite resistance.</p>

<p id="id01060">The sea was clearly visible for a one-mile radius around
the Nautilus.  What a sight!  What pen could describe it?
Who could portray the effects of this light through these translucent
sheets of water, the subtlety of its progressive shadings into
the ocean's upper and lower strata?</p>

<p id="id01061">The transparency of salt water has long been recognized.
Its clarity is believed to exceed that of spring water.
The mineral and organic substances it holds in suspension actually
increase its translucency.  In certain parts of the Caribbean Sea,
you can see the sandy bottom with startling distinctness as deep
as 145 meters down, and the penetrating power of the sun's
rays seems to give out only at a depth of 300 meters.
But in this fluid setting traveled by the Nautilus, our electric
glow was being generated in the very heart of the waves.
It was no longer illuminated water, it was liquid light.</p>

<p id="id01062">If we accept the hypotheses of the microbiologist Ehrenberg—
who believes that these underwater depths are lit up by
phosphorescent organisms—nature has certainly saved one of her
most prodigious sights for residents of the sea, and I could
judge for myself from the thousandfold play of the light.
On both sides I had windows opening over these unexplored depths.
The darkness in the lounge enhanced the brightness outside, and we
stared as if this clear glass were the window of an immense aquarium.</p>

<p id="id01063">The Nautilus seemed to be standing still.  This was due to the lack
of landmarks.  But streaks of water, parted by the ship's spur,
sometimes threaded before our eyes with extraordinary speed.</p>

<p id="id01064">In wonderment, we leaned on our elbows before these show windows,
and our stunned silence remained unbroken until Conseil said:</p>

<p id="id01065">"You wanted to see something, Ned my friend; well, now you have
something to see!"</p>

<p id="id01066">"How unusual!" the Canadian put in, setting aside his tantrums
and getaway schemes while submitting to this irresistible allure.
"A man would go an even greater distance just to stare at such a sight!"</p>

<p id="id01067">"Ah!"  I exclaimed.  "I see our captain's way of life!
He's found himself a separate world that saves its most astonishing
wonders just for him!"</p>

<p id="id01068">"But where are the fish?" the Canadian ventured to observe.<br/>

"I don't see any fish!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01069">"Why would you care, Ned my friend?"  Conseil replied.<br/>

"Since you have no knowledge of them."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01070">"Me?  A fisherman!"  Ned Land exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01071">And on this subject a dispute arose between the two friends, since both
were knowledgeable about fish, but from totally different standpoints.</p>

<p id="id01072">Everyone knows that fish make up the fourth and last class in
the vertebrate branch.  They have been quite aptly defined as:
"cold-blooded vertebrates with a double circulatory system,
breathing through gills, and designed to live in water."
They consist of two distinct series:  the series of bony fish,
in other words, those whose spines have vertebrae made of bone;
and cartilaginous fish, in other words, those whose spines have
vertebrae made of cartilage.</p>

<p id="id01073">Possibly the Canadian was familiar with this distinction, but Conseil
knew far more about it; and since he and Ned were now fast friends,
he just had to show off.  So he told the harpooner:</p>

<p id="id01074">"Ned my friend, you're a slayer of fish, a highly skilled fisherman.<br/>

You've caught a large number of these fascinating animals.<br/>

But I'll bet you don't know how they're classified."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01075">"Sure I do," the harpooner replied in all seriousness.<br/>

"They're classified into fish we eat and fish we don't eat!"<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01076">"Spoken like a true glutton," Conseil replied.  "But tell me,
are you familiar with the differences between bony fish
and cartilaginous fish?"</p>

<p id="id01077">"Just maybe, Conseil."</p>

<p id="id01078">"And how about the subdivisions of these two large classes?"</p>

<p id="id01079">"I haven't the foggiest notion," the Canadian replied.</p>

<p id="id01080">"All right, listen and learn, Ned my friend!  Bony fish are subdivided
into six orders.  Primo, the acanthopterygians, whose upper jaw is fully
formed and free-moving, and whose gills take the shape of a comb.
This order consists of fifteen families, in other words,
three-quarters of all known fish.  Example:  the common perch."</p>

<p id="id01081">"Pretty fair eating," Ned Land replied.</p>

<p id="id01082">"Secundo," Conseil went on, "the abdominals, whose pelvic fins hang
under the abdomen to the rear of the pectorals but aren't attached to
the shoulder bone, an order that's divided into five families and makes
up the great majority of freshwater fish.  Examples:  carp, pike."</p>

<p id="id01083">"Ugh!" the Canadian put in with distinct scorn.  "You can keep
the freshwater fish!"</p>

<p id="id01084">"Tertio," Conseil said, "the subbrachians, whose pelvic fins are
attached under the pectorals and hang directly from the shoulder bone.
This order contains four families.  Examples:  flatfish such
as sole, turbot, dab, plaice, brill, etc."</p>

<p id="id01085">"Excellent, really excellent!" the harpooner exclaimed, interested in
fish only from an edible viewpoint.</p>

<p id="id01086">"Quarto," Conseil went on, unabashed, "the apods, with long bodies
that lack pelvic fins and are covered by a heavy, often glutinous skin,
an order consisting of only one family.  Examples:  common eels
and electric eels."</p>

<p id="id01087">"So-so, just so-so!" Ned Land replied.</p>

<p id="id01088">"Quinto," Conseil said, "the lophobranchians, which have fully formed,
free-moving jaws but whose gills consist of little tufts arranged
in pairs along their gill arches.  This order includes only
one family.  Examples:  seahorses and dragonfish."</p>

<p id="id01089">"Bad, very bad!" the harpooner replied.</p>

<p id="id01090">"Sexto and last," Conseil said, "the plectognaths, whose maxillary
bone is firmly attached to the side of the intermaxillary that forms
the jaw, and whose palate arch is locked to the skull by sutures
that render the jaw immovable, an order lacking true pelvic fins
and which consists of two families.  Examples:  puffers and moonfish."</p>

<p id="id01091">"They're an insult to a frying pan!" the Canadian exclaimed.</p>

<p id="id01092">"Are you grasping all this, Ned my friend?" asked the scholarly Conseil.</p>

<p id="id01093">"Not a lick of it, Conseil my friend," the harpooner replied.<br/>

"But keep going, because you fill me with fascination."<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01094">"As for cartilaginous fish," Conseil went on unflappably,
"they consist of only three orders."</p>

<p id="id01095">"Good news," Ned put in.</p>

<p id="id01096">"Primo, the cyclostomes, whose jaws are fused into a flexible
ring and whose gill openings are simply a large number of holes,
an order consisting of only one family.  Example:  the lamprey."</p>

<p id="id01097">"An acquired taste," Ned Land replied.</p>

<p id="id01098">"Secundo, the selacians, with gills resembling those of the cyclostomes
but whose lower jaw is free-moving. This order, which is the most
important in the class, consists of two families.  Examples:  the ray
and the shark."</p>

<p id="id01099">"What!"  Ned Land exclaimed.  "Rays and man-eaters in the same order?
Well, Conseil my friend, on behalf of the rays, I wouldn't advise
you to put them in the same fish tank!"</p>

<p id="id01100">"Tertio," Conseil replied, "The sturionians, whose gill opening is
the usual single slit adorned with a gill cover, an order consisting
of four genera.  Example:  the sturgeon."</p>

<p id="id01101">"Ah, Conseil my friend, you saved the best for last, in my
opinion anyhow!  And that's all of 'em?"</p>

<p id="id01102">"Yes, my gallant Ned," Conseil replied.  "And note well, even when one
has grasped all this, one still knows next to nothing, because these
families are subdivided into genera, subgenera, species, varieties—"</p>

<p id="id01103">"All right, Conseil my friend," the harpooner said, leaning toward
the glass panel, "here come a couple of your varieties now!"</p>

<p id="id01104">"Yes!  Fish!"  Conseil exclaimed.  "One would think he was in front
of an aquarium!"</p>

<p id="id01105">"No," I replied, "because an aquarium is nothing more than a cage,
and these fish are as free as birds in the air!"</p>

<p id="id01106">"Well, Conseil my friend, identify them!  Start naming them!"<br/>

Ned Land exclaimed.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01107">"Me?"  Conseil replied.  "I'm unable to!  That's my employer's bailiwick!"</p>

<p id="id01108">And in truth, although the fine lad was a classifying maniac, he was
no naturalist, and I doubt that he could tell a bonito from a tuna.
In short, he was the exact opposite of the Canadian, who knew nothing
about classification but could instantly put a name to any fish.</p>

<p id="id01109">"A triggerfish," I said.</p>

<p id="id01110">"It's a Chinese triggerfish," Ned Land replied.</p>

<p id="id01111">"Genus Balistes, family Scleroderma, order Plectognatha,"<br/>

Conseil muttered.<br/>
</p>

<p id="id01112">Assuredly, Ned and Conseil in combination added up to
one outstanding naturalist.</p>

<p id="id01113">The Canadian was not mistaken.  Cavorting around the Nautilus
was a school of triggerfish with flat bodies, grainy skins,
armed with stings on their dorsal fins, and with four prickly
rows of quills quivering on both sides of their tails.
Nothing could have been more wonderful than the skin covering them:
white underneath, gray above, with spots of gold sparkling in
the dark eddies of the waves.  Around them, rays were undulating
like sheets flapping in the wind, and among these I spotted,
much to my glee, a Chinese ray, yellowish on its topside, a dainty
pink on its belly, and armed with three stings behind its eyes;
a rare species whose very existence was still doubted in Lacépède's day,
since that pioneering classifier of fish had seen one only in a
portfolio of Japanese drawings.</p>

<p id="id01114">For two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the Nautilus.  In the midst
of their leaping and cavorting, while they competed with each other
in beauty, radiance, and speed, I could distinguish some green wrasse,
bewhiskered mullet marked with pairs of black lines, white gobies from
the genus Eleotris with curved caudal fins and violet spots on the back,
wonderful Japanese mackerel from the genus Scomber with blue bodies
and silver heads, glittering azure goldfish whose name by itself
gives their full description, several varieties of porgy or gilthead
(some banded gilthead with fins variously blue and yellow,
some with horizontal heraldic bars and enhanced by a black strip
around their caudal area, some with color zones and elegantly corseted
in their six waistbands), trumpetfish with flutelike beaks that looked
like genuine seafaring woodcocks and were sometimes a meter long,
Japanese salamanders, serpentine moray eels from the genus Echidna
that were six feet long with sharp little eyes and a huge mouth
bristling with teeth; etc.</p>

<p id="id01115">Our wonderment stayed at an all-time fever pitch.
Our exclamations were endless.  Ned identified the fish,
Conseil classified them, and as for me, I was in ecstasy over
the verve of their movements and the beauty of their forms.
Never before had I been given the chance to glimpse these animals
alive and at large in their native element.</p>

<p id="id01116">Given such a complete collection from the seas of Japan and China, I
won't mention every variety that passed before our dazzled eyes.
More numerous than birds in the air, these fish raced right up to us,
no doubt attracted by the brilliant glow of our electric beacon.</p>

<p id="id01117">Suddenly daylight appeared in the lounge.  The sheet-iron panels
slid shut.  The magical vision disappeared.  But for a good
while I kept dreaming away, until the moment my eyes focused on
the instruments hanging on the wall.  The compass still showed our
heading as east-northeast, the pressure gauge indicated a pressure
of five atmospheres (corresponding to a depth of fifty meters),
and the electric log gave our speed as fifteen miles per hour.</p>

<p id="id01118">I waited for Captain Nemo.  But he didn't appear.  The clock marked
the hour of five.</p>

<p id="id01119">Ned Land and Conseil returned to their cabin.  As for me,
I repaired to my stateroom.  There I found dinner ready for me.
It consisted of turtle soup made from the daintiest hawksbill,
a red mullet with white, slightly flaky flesh, whose liver,
when separately prepared, makes delicious eating, plus loin of
imperial angelfish, whose flavor struck me as even better than salmon.</p>
